EDO CASTLE - DECEMBER, 1631

14
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,362
Elder...

15
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,365
So you are here.

16
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:56,382
I am Chief Jingoza of the Third Iga Group,

17
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,145
serving the Shogunate.

18
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,522
This is top secert.

19
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,082
Come closer.

20
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,445
His Excellency's illness
has been determined

21
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,037
to be incurable.

22
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:34,947
He has 20 days left at best.

23
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:41,383
It will soon be Lord lemitsu's
time to reign as Shogun.

24
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:46,588
We must avoid any current upheavals.

25
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,909
Where do we go?

26
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,144
To Sumpu.

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,239
Sumpu...

28
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:09,514
Are you reffering to Lord Tadanaga?

29
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:17,730
Lord Tadanaga is His Excellency's son

30
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,496
and the younger brother to Lord lemitsu.

31
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,904
He is trying to bypass
Lord lemitsu to become Shogun.

32
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:35,976
He is gathering pacts
from the Tozama lords.

33
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,953
Upon His Excellency's death,

34
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:48,190
he plans to raise an army and attack Edo.

35
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:53,266
If the Edo Castle should go up in flames,

36
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,099
the country will be in upheaval.

37
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,337
Jingoza, we must nip it at it's bud.

38
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:12,785
Go to Sumpu with your group of Iga ninja

39
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,983
and steal the compact
before His Excellency dies.

40
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,552
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:29,569
Upon His Excellency's death...

42
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,265
we will provide our solid proof...

43
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,606
And force Lord Tadanaga
to commit suicide.

44
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,512
Is that clear?

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,215
There is only one reign
in this country for us.

46
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,464
Do you understand your assignment?

47
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,613
Needless to say...

48
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,654
Per the Iga Code under
the Shogunate Agents...

49
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,714
I shall abide by the order given to me.

50
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,216
Jihei!

51
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:34,334
Take four men with you
along the Koshu Highway.

52
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,168
Enter Suruga via
Kajikizawa and Fujigawa.

53
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:42,938
Shinsoku, Denpachi, Koroku, and Yaichi...

54
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,913
Follow Jihei's orders.

55
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,911
Saheiji!

56
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,923
Take the Atsuki Highway
to go to Ashigara.

57
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,127
Enter Suruga via Takenoshita.

58
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:07,964
Gensaku, Ittetsu, Magosuke...

59
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,934
You men follow Saheiji's orders.

60
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,834
Takei!

61
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,609
Take the Atsumi Highway to go to Ito.

62
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,616
Enter Suruga via Shuzenji and Izu.

63
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,949
Genshin, Umenosuke, Shume...

64
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,729
You men follow Tahei's orders.

65
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:46,668
Bunzo and Hanshiro who are left...

66
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,333
You will accompany me.

67
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,109
We will enter Suruga through
the backroads of Hakone.

68
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,912
Kozue, stay back in Edo to
prepare for the unexpected.

69
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,356
Follow the Elder's orders.

70
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,826
Be prepared for His Excellency's death.

71
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,994
You will probably have to
dash over to Suruga to notify us.

72
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,835
After the battle in Osaka...

73
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:25,870
Our Iga group of 60 men
has been reduced to just 16.

74
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,343
They say sacrifices must
be made for the future.

75
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,578
But we have lost a lot of
men over the past 17 years.

76
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,623
They were all invaluable men, too.

77
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,791
They were all your comrades.

78
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,934
Your parents, siblings, and relatives.

79
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:59,612
Even if it comes down to the last man...

80
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,207
We must fullfill our duties.

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,582
In the honor of the Iga ninja!

82
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,489
Let us meet in Sumpu!

83
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,547
Let's go!

84
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,669
Let's go!

85
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,826
MAIN WING

86
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,940
INUI GATE

87
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,564
That is the ninja
that was captured earlier.

88
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,727
He tried to make his
way through the outer moat.

89
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,531
They caught another one at the
Southeast Gate disguised as a vendor.

90
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,765
INUI GATE

91
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,073
FIRST GATE

92
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,247
FIRST GATE

93
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,579
It's another Shogunate ninja.

94
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,991
He will be taken to
Kimon (Demon's Gate ) Tower, too.

95
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,524
I don't like that place.

96
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,098
SECOND GATE

97
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,200
KIMON (DEMON'S GATE) TOWER

98
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,017
That's the fourth one.

99
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,042
We have Sir Saiga on our side.

100
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,381
He knows how the ninja operate.

101
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,510
Rain?

102
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,533
Bunzo and Hanshiro...

103
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:02,946
Shinsaku and Yoichi
haven't come back yet.

104
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:13,285
I ordered them to sneak
into the Main Wing tonight.

105
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,862
Chief...

106
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,525
Was there a calculated reason for it?

107
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,227
Chief!

108
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,801
No... there was none.

109
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,306
There was no calculated reason behind it.

110
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,237
Is the pact safe?

111
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,103
Men!

112
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,547
Remove that folding screen!

113
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,845
It will become a good
hiding spot for the ninja!

114
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,684
Increase the candlestands!

115
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,581
Leave the sliding doors open!

116
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,454
Keep the fires at a distance!

117
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,654
It will make you drowsy!

118
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,043
Stop!

119
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,748
Close the path by Southeast Tower!

120
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,113
That's their only way out!

121
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,321
Are things under control?

122
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:40,165
All the commotion in the castle is gone.

123
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,134
It appears they are dead...

124
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:53,307
Ishiwaki Shinsoku and Isshiki Yaichi...

125
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,243
They were both valuable men.

126
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,212
Cheif, the castle samurai should
have their guards down now.

127
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,649
Perhaps we should
send in someone else now.

128
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,222
It will be useless.

129
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,736
To get to this inner
moat of the Main Wing...

130
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:23,368
We have to cross this
outer moat from the Ote Gate.

131
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,880
Even if we succeed in
getting into the castle...

132
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,939
We will be caught by the castle guards.

133
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,820
If they close the path by Southeast Tower,

134
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,050
we will be cornered.

135
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,958
It's geographical features and defenses...

136
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,920
Makes it an impregnable fortress.

137
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,801
There is no way out alive.

138
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,866
Our enemy ninja is well aware of that.

139
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,276
Damn Saiga!

140
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,743
Saiga Magokuro of the
Negoro ninja from Kishu...

141
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:09,178
Lord Suruga has a
fine ninja in his service.

142
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,156
We are up against someone
who knows all the ninja tricks.

143
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,794
Our ordinary tactics won't work.

144
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,357
Chief...

145
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
Knowing that, you sent
those two men in there tonight?

146
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:30,002
I lost six men in all...

147
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,606
They were all excellent ninja.

148
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,480
But there was no other method.

149
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,324
Even if Saiga may not fall for it...

150
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,157
The castle guards may.

151
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:56,399
I'm hoping the Suruga
samurai will take the bait.

152
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,113
Tomorrow morning,
Narita Uji will transfer the pact

153
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,173
to the Kimon Tower.

154
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,317
Any objections?

155
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,956
The ninja would never
suspect that we would

156
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:22,052
transfer the valuable pact in this crisis.

157
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,564
Even if they were to
make it to the Main Wing,

158
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,795
they will panic if
they can't find the pact.

159
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,264
Saiga, what do you want?

160
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,603
Pardon my rudeness.

161
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,348
Please do not move the
pact from the Main Wing.

162
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,284
Did you eavesdrop?

163
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,617
Saiga, who do you
think you are speaking to?

164
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,222
Refrain!

165
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,156
You don't seem to realize it.

166
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,026
You are taking their bait.

167
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,127
Bait?

168
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,395
What are you talking about?

169
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,665
Those Shogunate ninja
can't make it to the Main Wing,

170
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,734
so as a desperate measure,
they have caused those riots

171
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,771
to intimidate you into moving
the pact to somewhere else.

172
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,897
Hold your tongue!

173
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,936
You are just a greenhorn!

174
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,974
How dare you insult us!

175
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,315
Forgive me for my insults, but...

176
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,509
Stop! Saiga.

177
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:22,316
It just goes to show
your background doesn't it?

178
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,648
You don't seem to understand
the hardships of the others.

179
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,925
All that matters to you is the pact.

180
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:39,635
But we must also think
about our lord's safety.

181
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:44,243
If more of these riots should
take place and the guards get

182
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:49,514
preoccupied with the pact,
then the Shogunate ninja could

183
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,984
very well get to the lord.

184
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,679
Then we will be faced with a crisis.

185
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,588
The death of all of us
here won't suffice as apolpgy.

186
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:05,697
Chamberlain, are you not prepared to die?

187
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,823
Saigo!

188
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,738
If you are not prepared to die
or to have the lord lose an arm

189
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,874
or leg, then you will never
accomplish your mission.

190
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,068
Saiga, refrain!

191
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,610
How dare you!

192
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,838
Ignore him.

193
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,143
A hired ninja would
not be able to understand.

194
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,684
In any event,
we are moving the pact to

195
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,312
Kimon Tower tomorrow.

196
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,656
I will send 15 or 16 of our most skilled
swordsmen to Kimon Tower.

197
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,233
Stop!

198
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,430
That's fine! Go to Ninomaru!

199
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,808
Farmer Jisaku and eleven
others from Udo village are here

200
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,443
to make the rice delivery.

201
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,604
Let the ones who have
been checked, pass.

202
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,315
Hey! Where are you going?

203
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:09,154
The tools to do the
repairs are outside the gate.

204
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,553
Go, quickly!

205
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,313
Excuse me!

206
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,549
Stop!

207
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,191
Don't let him escape!

208
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,259
Stop!

209
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,766
Did you find it?

210
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,571
No, he might have dropped it in the moat.

211
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,548
Take him to Kimon Tower.
We will open up his stomach.

212
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,621
Ninja have a tendency to
hide it inside their stomach.

213
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,918
Remember that.

214
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,513
You Shogunate dog!

215
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,591
The pact was moved to Kimon Tower.

216
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:35,273
To move it a short distance
from the Main Wing to the

217
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,174
Kimon Tower...

218
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,069
Four men have been lost.

219
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:48,379
From the time we left Edo we
have lost eight men already.

220
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,648
All good men, too!

221
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,490
Chief...

222
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:07,066
Hanshiro, take out the
paper package on you.

223
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:12,800
The one you have been holding
dearly since you have left Edo.

224
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:19,216
I take it that the content is
my sister, Kozue's hairpin.

225
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,903
Chief...

226
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:42,033
Don't say anything.
I am not condemning you.

227
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:48,511
I have known for a while
now that you two are lovers.

228
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:57,289
After you safely complete
your assignment...

229
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,849
I was thinking of letting
you two get together.

230
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:07,190
But I am afraid that that
might not happen anymore.

231
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,542
From the start...

232
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:23,811
I knew this wasn't going to be easy.

233
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:30,319
But it turned out to be
harder than I anticipated.

234
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,937
Pull yourself together.

235
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,639
Come closer.

236
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,917
I need you to go Sumpu immediately.

237
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:13,795
His Excellency passed away this morning.

238
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,766
There will be chaos soon.

239
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,305
We have no time to waste.

240
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,103
Tell Jingoza to steal the pact immediately.

241
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,400
Yes, sir.

242
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:32,750
Aren't you the only kin of Jingoza?

243
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,409
Yes.

244
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,956
He has worked very hard for us.

245
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,485
We have asked the
impossible of him many times.

246
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,399
Though it was for the
peace of the country,

247
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,060
we have sent him through many trials.

248
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:56,240
And I am telling him
and his group to die now.

249
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,172
Elder...

250
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:04,010
Kozue, please be sure to tell him this.

251
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,786
I, Abe Bungo, will depart
Odawara tomorrow morning,

252
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,481
in reliance of him.

253
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,258
If he should fail to get that pact,

254
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:17,251
then I will kill Lord Tadanaga myself.

255
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,625
I will be sure to tell him that.

256
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:23,289
I will deliver the pact to you
before you arrive in Sumpu.

257
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,865
Chamberlain...

258
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,577
I hear you received
urgent news from Edo.

259
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,513
Yes, from Aoki Shuzen,
the Steward in Edo.

260
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,912
What did he have to say?

261
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,920
Elder Abe Bungo has
reported himself as being ill,

262
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,515
but is actually in Odawara.

263
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,228
He must be panicking since
the Shogun is near his death.

264
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,629
The Shogunate ninja must be frantic now.

265
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,567
We must be on our guard.

266
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,770
I want you to tell Saiga that.

267
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,896
Yes, sir.

268
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,233
What is this?

269
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,277
The identities of the
Shogunate ninja in town,

270
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,710
and their hideout.

271
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,807
"The Shogunate ninja sent,
are from Iga Group Three.

272
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,216
"They are Jingoza and 15 others.

273
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,949
"They are staying at Rakan-ji
Temple in Sumpu castletown."

274
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,294
RAKAN-JI

275
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,170
Is the back covered?

276
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,694
Yes, as you have ordered.

277
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,864
Good.

278
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,595
The ninja aren't showing up.

279
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,761
They won't show themselves so easily.

280
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,566
Be on the alert.

281
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,185
Hanshiro, is that you?

282
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,018
Yes.

283
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,921
Chief, the Suruga samurai
have this place covered.

284
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,955
Please leave immediately.

285
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,758
I know that.

286
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,467
But I can't escape.

287
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:18,037
The Negoro ninja have this place
secured with their "Death Trap".

288
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,942
He is a subservant for the temple.

289
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,214
Saiga...

290
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,881
That geezer is talking to someone.

291
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,789
But who?

292
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:50,398
After I am gone, you are
in charge of the Iga group.

293
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,276
Chief, I am not a leader.

294
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,840
No, you have to take charge.

295
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,421
Even if it comes down
to the very last man...

296
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:08,381
You must sneak into
Kimon Tower and steal the pact.

297
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,459
I'm counting on you to do it.

298
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,397
Ok.

299
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,195
I'm changing the plans.

300
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,369
When you get into the castle...

301
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,133
Don't make any moves for a whole day.

302
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,242
You must get their guard down,

303
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,142
or you won't make it out alive.

304
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,514
Hanshiro, don't mind me and escape.

305
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,694
He must have a comrade with him.

306
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,718
Find him.

307
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,793
Stop!

308
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,594
It's useless to go after him!

309
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,254
What a shame!
We only have one old man.

310
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,884
An old man?

311
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,528
Is that what he appears to you?

312
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:37,412
It's all right.
His leg should be broken.

313
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,586
How smart of you to
disguise yourself as a sexton.

314
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,625
Do you think I Saiga Magokuro, am blind?

315
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:05,071
I can see through your ninja disguise.

316
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,148
Am I wrong...

317
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:14,016
Chief Jingoza of Iga
Group Three Shogunate ninja?

318
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,873
So you have lost to the Negoro ninja?

319
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,645
Jingoza, do you want it?

320
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,916
The item you want is in there.

321
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,518
It's the pact!

322
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,753
Do you want to steal it?

323
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,899
But you can't run far with that leg.

324
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,658
Did he confess anything?

325
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,497
An Iga ninja wouldn't give
in and confess with torture.

326
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,277
Especially not the Iga Chief.

327
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,767
Why don't you just kill him?

328
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:21,615
You are mad to confine him
in the tower the pact is in!

329
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,989
Jingoza is the only strong
ninja in the Iga Group Three!

330
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,916
The others are worthless!

331
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:33,291
But they will come to save their chief.

332
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,332
That's when we will capture
every single one of them.

333
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:45,675
Now you know how
superior the Negoro ninja are.

334
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,943
There are 16 of them while
there is only one of me.

335
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,411
And look at the result.

336
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:59,346
They are in a very
disadvantagious situation.

337
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:03,324
I will beat them so that
they can never stand again.

338
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,390
Did you hear that Jingoza?

339
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:14,332
Every time I kill one of your
men, I will have you verify it.

340
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:19,004
I will make you feel defeat
to the core of your bones!

341
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,981
Saiga, I am fine with your plan, but...

342
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,418
Be sure to guard the pact well.

343
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,258
If you are so worried,
move it back to the Main Wing.

344
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:39,230
No. The pact will stay
in this Kimon Tower.

345
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,098
But, Steward...

346
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,761
It is your duty to protect
the lord and the pact.

347
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,034
Forget about the other ninja.

348
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:53,072
You can kill him when you want.
But the earlier the better.

349
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:14,159
He is skilled and smart...
What a shame.

350
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,161
I agree...

351
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,195
But he is a hard man to handle.

352
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,400
It might be best to get rid
of him after the job is done.

353
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,348
Will you say something?

354
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,420
Bunzo!

355
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,933
I don't get it.

356
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:23,957
What?

357
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,894
I just don't get it.
What else can I say?

358
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,909
Why did the Chief leave
Hanshiro in command?

359
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,247
Be it in age or skill...

360
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,908
There are others more capable.

361
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,047
I don't think I am
at all inferior to Hanshiro.

362
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,109
Are you discontent, Hanshiro?

363
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,654
No, not that.

364
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:51,586
But the Chief's order is final.

365
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,697
But...

366
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,292
He could have escaped
if he used me as a decoy.

367
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:02,073
But he became the
decoy and let me escape...

368
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,808
and told me to take command.

369
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,345
Are you saying that
was the Chief's compassion?

370
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,711
He is not one to be so ill-prepared!

371
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:19,245
He has sacrificed eight
men for this job already.

372
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,182
He wouldn't let himself
get caught so easily.

373
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:30,097
I think this is all part of his plan.

374
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,302
What do you think it is?

375
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,366
I don't know.

376
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,006
But I will follow his orders.

377
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,276
Isn't that our... Iga code?

378
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,576
If you have objections, speak up.

379
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,115
I won't force those
who are not convinced.

380
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,230
Even if I am alone,
I will follow the Chief's order

381
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,221
and carry out our mission.

382
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,496
Who is there?

383
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,671
Kozue!

384
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,209
Hanshiro...

385
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,878
Where is my brother?

386
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,991
I have bad news.

387
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:36,155
The Chief was captured
and taken to the castle.

388
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,398
Emergency!

389
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,169
Saiga!

390
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,605
Saiga!

391
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,208
Saiga!

392
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,547
Ah, Saiga!

393
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,555
There has been an urgent
notice from Hakone Station.

394
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,828
Abe Bungo has the gall to show up!

395
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,106
Saiga, where are you going?

396
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,393
How is Kozue?

397
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,035
The exhaustion from the trip
and the shocking news about

398
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,662
the Chief hit her hard...

399
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:54,275
I will relay the message
she brought to everyone.

400
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:02,183
His Excellency has passed away.

401
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,792
Elder Abe Bungo who is
staying in Odawara incognito,

402
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,363
will be entering the Sumpu
Castle the morning after tomorrow

403
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,194
as the official Shogunate envoy.

404
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,363
We have no time to waste.

405
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:24,174
We have to steal the pact before then...

406
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,769
On our Iga ninja honor!

407
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:35,548
Let us sneak into Sumpu Castle tonight!

408
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,250
I will go alone if I have to.

409
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,107
Saiga...

410
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,708
The night kite is up, just as I thought.

411
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,549
You probably can't see it.

412
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:10,077
About five miles beyond that
grove is the Iga night kite.

413
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,149
Probably around the
Shizuhata Mountain...

414
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,821
What is an Iga night kite?

415
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:22,099
They put a light on a black kite at night,

416
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,124
to notify their comrades of their location.

417
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,602
It's an Iga ninja signal.

418
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,505
We are safe while that light is up...

419
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,607
Hanshiro...

420
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,677
Time is moving.
Let us hear your order.

421
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,885
Listen up, everyone.

422
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,658
Will you die at the orders
of a greenhorn like me?

423
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,296
Jihei!

424
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,838
That goes without saying.

425
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,870
An Iga ninja dies at the order of the Chief.

426
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,373
That is our code.

427
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:16,851
Saheiji, I have no plan in mind.

428
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,290
I am leaving our fate
in the hands of heaven.

429
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,723
You are the Chief.

430
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,491
All you have to do is to tell us to die.

431
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:31,765
Denpachi, I am going
to be asking you to die.

432
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,766
I have been waiting for you to say that.

433
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,300
Magosuke...

434
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,635
I will do as you say.

435
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,082
Koroku, what about you?

436
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:49,109
All right, all right...
I am getting excited already.

437
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,121
I will go, too.

438
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,331
No, Kozue...

439
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,966
Hanshiro, I...

440
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,594
We have no time or
plan to save the Chief.

441
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,164
We have no chance of returning alive.

442
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:16,574
That is why we want at least you to live.

443
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,972
That is our last wish.

444
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,545
It is our farewell gift to the Chief.

445
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,429
Bunzo...

446
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,334
They cut it.

447
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,242
Are they coming now?

448
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,672
What?

449
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,709
What's the situation in the front?

450
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,802
The security is tight.

451
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,875
We won't be able to cross the moat.

452
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,871
What about the sides?

453
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,350
Same. It's impossible.

454
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,854
What about the water gate?

455
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,754
There are a lot of guards there, too.

456
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,482
It's geographically impossible
to sneak in from there.

457
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,222
There are a lot of guards
at the Southeast Gate, too.

458
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,567
We can go in through the Ushitora moat.

459
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,598
What? Ushitora moat?

460
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,885
The tower is far from there.

461
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,410
It's a perfect place to hide.

462
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,486
And the security is lax.

463
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,825
What about the moat?

464
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,259
There are no patrol boats.
I verified it.

465
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,063
Are there any lights in that area?

466
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,792
No. It's pitch dark.

467
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,935
That must be a trap.

468
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,924
Trap?

469
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,070
They are trying to lure us in.

470
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,170
There must be an army
waiting for us on the inside.

471
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,773
It appears that they
are taking us very lightly.

472
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,065
I lied that it was urgent business

473
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:53,298
and got the laborers to
return from the outskirts.

474
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,072
Interesting!

475
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,835
Shall we take advantage of the chaos?

476
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,949
Does it seem like they will
come in from Ushitora moat?

477
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,814
They won't fail so easily.

478
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,084
What do you mean?

479
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,856
A greenhorn as he may be,
but he is still an Iga ninja.

480
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:18,295
He will try to lure us
out by laying a trap first,

481
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,355
then enter through Ushitora
moat, where our trap is.

482
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,362
I hope you are well-prepared for them.

483
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,280
It's past the closing time!

484
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,720
We are aware of the regulations.

485
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,024
That is why we stayed
at the outskirts of town.

486
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,891
But we received an order
to deliver it by tonight.

487
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,398
Nonsense!
We weren't informed of it at all.

488
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,666
It must be a mistake!

489
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,190
You are the one who is mistaken!

490
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,232
Are you dreaming?

491
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,695
What insolence!
I won't stand for it!

492
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,898
Stop!

493
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:04,741
Let them come in!

494
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,675
Let them pass after
they have been checked.

495
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,679
Why don't we go in now,
through the Ushitora moat?

496
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,743
We might be able to outsmart them.

497
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,976
Wait!

498
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,553
We won't make it. Look.

499
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,701
The chaos will be over soon.

500
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:41,803
The guards from the other
location aren't coming over.

501
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,006
Let's go.

502
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,075
Wait.

503
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,709
Now's our time to sneak
in and raise a ruckus.

504
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,420
I'm very good at that.

505
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,324
Don't worry about my
oldtime wife and four children.

506
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,653
I'm starting to feel worn out.

507
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,433
Jingoza would have used me now.

508
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:08,864
Sorry.

509
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,639
When you get through, send us a signal.

510
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:17,541
Don't rush to your death.

511
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,016
Let's pull the last two men out.

512
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,812
Let's go.

513
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,529
Group Six, 12th horse.

514
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,004
Horse caretaker, Matsukichi!

515
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,699
Are you Matsukichi?

516
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,498
Next!

517
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,669
13th horse caretaker, Tatsuzo!

518
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,643
Hurry up! Get into line!

519
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:55,976
Stop!

520
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,891
Don't let him escape!

521
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,240
Let's go through Ushitora now.

522
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:27,448
I will cross this moat.

523
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,052
And go through the Inui Gate?

524
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,280
Let's outsmart them.

525
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,556
They wouldn't expect it.

526
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,124
But there are many guards.

527
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,957
Don't oppose me!
Or I will kill you!

528
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,836
Saiga...

529
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,271
I'm going to Ushitora.
I'm taking the men with me.

530
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,938
How was it?

531
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,851
There is a security lookout.

532
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:37,649
The tower has full view of it.

533
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,048
I see.

534
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,106
This is the only place.

535
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,467
Let's climb it.

536
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:01,903
It will be tough to climb that.

537
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,746
But it's worth a try.

538
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,985
Jihei...

539
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,003
Wait.

540
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,375
I said wait

541
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,582
What's up?

542
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:46,783
Someone is coming.

543
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,045
I see a shadow.

544
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,360
What's up, Jihei?

545
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,901
It's the Chief's sister.

546
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,036
Is that you, Kozue?

547
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,333
Hanshiro...

548
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,068
I told you not to come.

549
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,974
Let's get going, Jihei.

550
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,440
I'm old already.

551
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,516
Don't be weak-willed.

552
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:23,878
Climb.

553
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,256
I will only be in your way.

554
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,156
Just leave me and go.

555
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:34,394
All right, take Kozue down with you.

556
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,734
You have an important assignment to do.

557
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,503
Tell the Elder tonight...

558
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:45,175
that we will get it
before he arrives in Sumpu.

559
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,335
All right.

560
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,405
There is no opening.

561
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,818
At this point, we can only forge ahead.

562
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,294
What's wrong?

563
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,311
Be on the alert!
Shoot down anyone suspicious!

564
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,219
Jihei!

565
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,832
Kozue, please go ahead.

566
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:32,235
No. Let me help you.

567
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,693
I know myself best.

568
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,076
I have worked as a ninja for 30 years.

569
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,512
I am at my limits.

570
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,406
Jihei!

571
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,444
I envy Saheiji for dying in action earlier.

572
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,987
Don't give up. Let's hurry.

573
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,925
What is that?

574
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,393
There they are!

575
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,599
Jihei!

576
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,370
Kozue, hurry and escape!

577
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,079
Jihei!

578
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,339
He was a tough one.

579
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:46,035
Indeed. There's another one!

580
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,274
There's another one! Shoot!

581
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,848
Someone is coming!

582
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,273
Is this where the shots came from?

583
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,106
Yes... we saw a shadow by the moat.

584
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,247
It's dark in here.

585
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,685
If it's lighted, we can't see very well.

586
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,017
It turned out to be a stray dog.

587
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,090
Fool! That ninja upstart, country samurai,

588
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,853
will make insulting remarks again!

589
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,426
It's almost daybreak.
Hang on there a bit longer.

590
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,758
If nothing happens,
alert the security station.

591
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:28,771
Do you still think they will show up?

592
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,706
Just be prepared for them.

593
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,016
But it's getting lighted.

594
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,176
They will come!

595
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:38,921
They let two of their
comrades die last night!

596
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,122
They wouldn't back down so easily!

597
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,096
I'm going to check the
situation at the Inui Gate.

598
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,529
Stay on alert for a bit more.

599
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:58,565
Hey.

600
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:00,900
Any changes?

601
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,112
No, none at all.

602
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,048
Not a single rat appeared.

603
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,106
Nothing.

604
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,743
How is it at Ichinokido?

605
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:16,991
We sent someone over about daybreak.

606
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:20,593
Did someone go over to check after that?

607
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,770
Nothing after that?

608
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,964
That's right.

609
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,838
It will be bright shortly.

610
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,343
How disappointing...

611
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,585
What are those Iga ninja up to?

612
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,591
Did the tight castle security scare them?

613
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,520
Are they helpless without their Chief?

614
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,531
No, that can't be...

615
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,268
The tenth and eleventh men
were killed by the Inui Gate.

616
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,976
They have five men left.
What happened to them?

617
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,446
Why aren't they appearing
at the Ushitora moat?

618
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,595
FIRST GATE

619
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,255
Damn!

620
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,059
Fools!

621
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,528
What happened here?

622
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,165
Damn you!

623
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,260
We are up against ninja!
Don't let your guard down!

624
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,023
Search thoroughly!
Don't let them escape!

625
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,664
Search well!

626
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,698
Give me that!

627
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:23,446
Saiga!

628
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,593
A ninja was found dead by
the Inui Gate's outer moat?

629
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,898
We pulled him out of the
moat and brought him here.

630
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,134
Take his body to the Kimon Tower.

631
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,499
I will meet you there.

632
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,262
Hey! Clean that spear!

633
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,509
Search for the two ninja!

634
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:07,991
Oh, it's him.

635
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:15,567
How admirable of him.
He sunk himself with a rock.

636
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,599
That makes five... all in one night!

637
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,646
There are only two left.

638
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:32,819
They are lost without their chief.

639
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:39,118
This will be the end of
the Iga Ninja Group Three!

640
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,730
Open your eyes!

641
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,671
The Iga ninja have lost!

642
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,110
I, Negoro ninja,

643
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:57,477
can take on 15 or 16 Iga ninja alone!

644
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,613
Look there!

645
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,618
It's the end of the famous Iga ninja!

646
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:12,288
Look here and there!

647
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:19,027
I will line the last two here very soon, too!

648
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,472
You won't get them so easily.

649
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:27,340
Hah! Enough of the tough talk!

650
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:33,414
Saiga, why are you so irate?

651
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,778
You, yourself, know it.

652
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:44,525
The last ones that remain
are the strongest.

653
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,488
And they are already
on the castle grounds.

654
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,701
The castle samurai have
not found them yet.

655
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:59,941
Victory or defeat has
yet to be determined.

656
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:01,302
Enough talk!

657
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:06,879
A ninja's fight will continue
until the very last man.

658
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,581
I'm sure you know that.

659
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,951
Sir Saiga!

660
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,386
What is it?

661
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,298
A ninja on the outskirts of town?

662
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,828
Damn Iga! Bring him here!

663
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,067
Wait! I will go.

664
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,274
Throw the bodies in the well.

665
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,693
We need water.

666
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:57,828
Don't move... or it will get worse.

667
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:00,368
How long must we wait like this?

668
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,001
Just a while more.

669
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,236
If we wait, will we be able to get through?

670
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,914
Listen, Hanshiro...
I have a couple of plans in mind.

671
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,449
What is it?

672
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,162
I will attack a samurai
outside the storehouse

673
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,527
and steal his uniform.

674
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:30,132
It will be suspicious if
we go straight to Ninokido,

675
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,535
so we will turn back once at Ichinokido,

676
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,264
then somehow get to the Kimon Tower.

677
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:43,012
The other plan is to set
fire to the storehouse nearby

678
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:48,348
and dash to the bushes in the
chaos and wait for nightfall.

679
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,281
Hanshiro...?

680
01:09:56,025 --> 01:10:00,189
I don't think we can even
make it to Ichinokido with that.

681
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,599
We will be discovered and killed.

682
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:09,771
Are we going to stay idle without a plan?

683
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,870
Staying here may
keep us from getting caught.

684
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,436
But without water, we will die.

685
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,952
We are the last of
the Iga Ninja Group Three!

686
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,922
Don't you want to escape out of here?

687
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,384
No.

688
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,897
Have you lost your nerve?

689
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,162
I'm not moving from here.

690
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:42,438
Listen, Hanshiro...
We still have energy left.

691
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,497
We are able to use
our ninja skills fully yet.

692
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,540
Let us get out of here.

693
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,447
Don't move from here.

694
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,321
That is my order.

695
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,551
You will...

696
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,658
You will dishonor our
group with a miserable end!

697
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,758
I won't take orders from you!

698
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,093
Have you forgotten our code?

699
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,427
If you don't follow orders, I will kill you.

700
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:19,068
Interesting!
Are you going to stop me?

701
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,250
A ninja has been caught!

702
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,799
It's Kozue...

703
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,901
What are we going to do, Hanshiro?

704
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,172
Are you going to let them kill her?

705
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,585
Search for the last ninja!

706
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,177
Search the area thoroughly!

707
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,359
Bring her here!

708
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,801
We caught another Iga ninja!

709
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,720
To think you were using
a woman as a messenger...

710
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:54,298
Woman! There are
15 ninja besides Jingoza!

711
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,636
Thirteen have already been killed.

712
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,003
And now we caught you.

713
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:04,642
Where is the last one?

714
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,477
Was he going to flee
back to Edo with you?

715
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,382
Or has he been hiding on the
castle grounds since last night?

716
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:19,589
Will you get it out of her?

717
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:23,229
Or shall I torture her?

718
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:24,992
It's useless.

719
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:26,702
What?

720
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:33,335
She won't talk even if her family is killed.

721
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:36,675
Fine!

722
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,739
I will put her through
the Negoro ninja torture!

723
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:47,181
I will give her a taste of our hell!

724
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,513
Take her to the torture room!

725
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:51,794
Sir Saiga!

726
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:52,818
What?

727
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,764
The Steward has
relieved the castle guards

728
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,891
from searching the storehouses!

729
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,526
What?!

730
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,979
FIRST GATE

731
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,007
Steward!

732
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,154
You must not relieve them!

733
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:22,885
Or all our efforts until
now will be for naught!

734
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:26,357
You have no proof that they
are hiding in those storehouses!

735
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,088
The incident at Ichinokido
is proof in itself!

736
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,656
They were all killed!

737
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:35,471
Which means there was a surviving ninja!

738
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,496
That is what you think.

739
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,440
They might sneak into the Main Wing.

740
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:46,479
They know that the pact is
being kept at the Kimon Tower.

741
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,513
Which means, they will have
to pass these storehouses.

742
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,217
How do you know that?

743
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,756
By the way Jingoza reacts...

744
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,417
That means nothing.

745
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:03,165
We can't rest the fate of
the 550,000-koku Suruga clan

746
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,292
on something unreliable as that!

747
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,365
Are there voices of discontent?

748
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:11,163
I have received numerous
complaints on your leadership.

749
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:15,236
Know your place as a newly hired vassal.

750
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,275
Tonight is a critical night.

751
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,648
The samurai must protect
the lord in the Main Wing.

752
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:31,119
Who knows what a
desperate ninja may do.

753
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,851
Please move the pact to
the Main Wing immediately.

754
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:39,190
Feeling a little timid?

755
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:43,666
Don't worry, I am not reducing
the guards at the Kimon Tower.

756
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,807
I have sent 15 or 16
skilled swordsmen as assistance.

757
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,504
That should be sufficient for a single ninja.

758
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,946
It's only for tonight anyway.

759
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:56,542
Steward!

760
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,650
You can have as many
foot soldiers as you want.

761
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:04,618
But they won't be of much help.

762
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:15,769
He is in there... I know it!

763
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,406
A ninja would find there
a perfect place to hide.

764
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,538
How do I capture him?

765
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,277
I can only rely on myself.

766
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:38,951
How can the 15 or 16
samurai possibly stop him?

767
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,308
Does it hurt, Hanshiro?

768
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:59,809
It's nothing serious.

769
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,708
I can still move.

770
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,151
If only we had water...

771
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,657
The salt on the wound
is what's causing it to sting.

772
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,797
It will alleviate the pain
if you could wash it out.

773
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,025
Forget about the water!

774
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,308
What's wrong, Bunzo?

775
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:36,573
Sorry... about what I said earlier.

776
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:45,416
I was just furious that
you weren't making a move.

777
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:51,133
You bear your thirst...
your pains from the injury...

778
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,268
and the pain of seeing
Kozue being taken away...

779
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,395
You are doing your best
to bear the unbearable.

780
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,531
You wasn't just doing
nothing and waiting here.

781
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,367
You were fighting
against Sumpu Castle, here.

782
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,903
Bunzo...

783
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:10,674
I used to think I was superior to you.

784
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:15,887
But you turned out to be
superior to me in everything.

785
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,017
I have lost to you.

786
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:42,572
How does it feel?

787
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,882
Shall I get to it now?

788
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,828
I will start with the horse taming method.

789
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,928
Then I will go on to more.
So confess now!

790
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:02,336
Who is the last ninja?

791
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:04,468
Where is he?

792
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:07,735
Talk!

793
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,410
So you won't talk?

794
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:14,706
All right...

795
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,210
Let's see you stick it out to the end then.

796
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:52,585
What's up with this?

797
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:55,715
Wait.

798
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,690
Let's call a dog.

799
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,665
Oh, it's a dog.

800
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,574
Don't move.

801
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:22,149
Or you will be shot.

802
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,511
That damn Saiga set a trap.

803
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:28,882
That fool!

804
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,566
Maybe I was too lenient with the whip.

805
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:44,806
Nail-peeling, finger-breaking,
skin-stripping...

806
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:49,411
You are better off dead
than going through our

807
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,572
Negoro ninja torture.

808
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,282
Will you bear through it all?

809
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:02,350
Kill me.

810
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,982
All right...

811
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,342
Let's go.

812
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:28,809
We all have our roles.

813
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,778
I will go out and cut off the lights.

814
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:35,853
The castle samurai think
there is only one man left.

815
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,385
If I go out, they won't expect another.

816
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,596
Dash to the Kimon Tower
during the chaos of it all.

817
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,459
Good luck.

818
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,565
Bye.

819
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,632
What happened?

820
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:54,468
So Bunzo has died...

821
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,567
What a shame.

822
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,902
He fought very well.

823
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:05,741
A great end for the
last man of the Iga group!

824
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:15,018
Why do you look at me like that?

825
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,689
Are you mocking me?

826
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:21,390
Mock me all you want!
But it's my victory!

827
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:23,798
As Shogunate ninja with a stipend,

828
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,663
you wouldn't understand how it is!

829
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,495
Do you know how hard I fought?

830
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,906
They mocked me for
my lowly ninja background

831
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,669
and blocked my every step!

832
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:36,800
They kept me out of the entire planning!

833
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:40,375
I fought within that great humiliation!

834
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:43,852
I fought against your
Iga ninja and my allies,

835
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,150
the Suruga samurai!

836
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,052
How foolish...

837
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,229
Foolish, you say?

838
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,958
You think I am foolish?

839
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,473
You were beaten by me.

840
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,729
We ninja are nothing but required to win.

841
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,334
Iga or Koga comes after the victory.

842
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:40,033
That is the way of the ninja.

843
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,240
I have won.

844
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,875
I will make the Negoro ninja
the agents for Suruga rule.

845
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:54,656
Saiga, unfortunately, that won't happen.

846
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,884
What?

847
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,155
I have won...

848
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:02,692
You have lost to my plan.

849
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,055
Your plan?

850
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:12,601
You didn't find it odd
that I was caught so easily.

851
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:21,647
As a matter of fact,
you let it get to your head.

852
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,811
And you lost all reasoning.

853
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:31,318
So the clansmen started
revolting against you.

854
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:37,989
In other words, you behaved
just the way I wanted you to.

855
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:43,394
This is an Iga technique
of causing revolting feelings.

856
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:45,932
Do you understand Saiga?

857
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:49,702
That was only until the match was met.

858
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:55,172
Look! I have won by myself!

859
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,346
The match hasn't been met yet.

860
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:02,847
Until the last man dies.

861
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,316
I can kill you off anytime.

862
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:09,696
I can't let you live anyway.

863
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,588
I'm not talking about myself!

864
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:21,533
Unfortunately, you were no match for us.

865
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:23,104
What?

866
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:32,544
Women aren't listed on
the Shogunate Ninja Register.

867
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,215
And you didn't know that.

868
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,823
There lies your miscalculation.

869
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,887
Then who is that woman?

870
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:47,534
Iga Kozue... my younger sister.

871
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:57,041
You are a very smart and skilled ninja.

872
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,405
I find that to be a shame.

873
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,186
Rather than regretfully dying in defeat,

874
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:11,025
go back to Kishu and leave
the Negoro name for future...

875
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:12,925
Say no more!

876
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,120
Where is the last man?

877
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:19,326
Are you going to ask me that?

878
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:25,398
I will kill him, too!

879
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:45,817
Guards!

880
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:21,050
Saiga, I came for the pact!

881
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:22,649
I see!

882
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,983
You must defeat a Negoro ninja first!

883
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:27,121
Take it by force!

884
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,094
This is it!

885
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:16,671
Chief!

886
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:18,195
Take this and go!

887
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,472
Please give this to the Shogunate envoy!

888
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:25,813
Please look after Kozue, too.

889
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:26,837
Chief!

890
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,043
Don't mind me and go!

891
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:40,621
Don't mind me or you
can't fullfill your assignment!

892
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:42,590
Go quickly!

893
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:52,500
Hanshiro, after you deliver this pact...

894
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:56,642
Don't go back to Edo.

895
01:31:56,944 --> 01:31:58,104
Brother!

896
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:03,105
Go back to Iga with Kozue.

897
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:08,950
Hanshiro...

898
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:13,449
A ninja has no family happiness.

899
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:21,500
I want that sadness to end with my time.

900
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:29,744
I want at least the two of you to grasp

901
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:33,009
human happiness...

902
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:37,807
No matter how small it may be.

903
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:43,385
Do you understand?

904
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:51,360
I wish both of you happiness.

905
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:58,267
Now, go.

906
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:00,804
Go!

907
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:12,108
Brother...

908
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:20,632
Thank you for coming from afar.

909
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:31,444
Wait

910
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,995
What is your name again?

911
01:36:43,364 --> 01:36:45,958
I'm Steward Narita Sukehachi.

912
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:49,335
I will remember your name.

913
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:58,837
Hattori!

914
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:05,309
Deliver this to Third Shogun lemitsu!

915
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,849
Don't rest along the way.

916
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:09,857
Run it all the way by horse!

917
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:10,915
Yes, sir!

918
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:18,891
Narita, lead the way.

919
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:44,146
LORD TADANAGA WAS CONFINED
IN KOFU IN JANUARY, 1632.

920
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:50,197
HE WAS THEN TRANSFERRED
TO TAKASAKI CASTLE IN JOSHU,

921
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:52,891
AND COMMITED SUICIDE IN DECEMBER.

922
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:22,585
THE SECRET OF THE
NINJA'S MERITORIOUS SERVICE

923
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:26,860
WAS LOST IN THE VILLAGE OF IGA,

924
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:31,098
AND NOT A TRACE REMAINS TODAY.

925
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:46,011
