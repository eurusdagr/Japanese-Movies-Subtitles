TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents

2
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:19,780
Hello, this is Sasaki prep school.

3
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:23,116
Do you want talk with an office
manager? One moment, please.

4
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:28,250
When you take innocent girls
to a hotel, they act scared.

5
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,953
They don't even want to come
in to a room... what a trouble...

6
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,824
Just ask her to make tea first.

7
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,295
Is Yumiko at work?

8
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:36,697
You shouldn't work at the
school for over 5 years.

9
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:38,098
First of all, you get
paid too much.

10
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:40,069
Acquaintance?

11
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,094
That's Dash.

12
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,663

ISHIDA Eri
KOSAKA Kazuya

16
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:06,093
U-A=J, you can apply numbers
to this equation.

17
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,724
How long does it take to get to Waseda?

18
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,358
By the way do you want to go
on a 100-kilo hike?

19
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,164
Let's repeat.

20
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:19,071
Can I borrow your Russian
notebook?

21
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,804
I have to go to a reception
tonight so I will be late.

22
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:26,840
50 years from now, I'll be 70
years old, you'll be...

<i>Directed by
FUJITA Toshiya</i>

26
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:55,161
The Unspoiled Diamond

27
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:14,155
He often visited his former
students after their graduation.

28
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:22,866
I heard a rumor that he took
care of them very well...

29
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,396
Don't worry. This is a
women's university.

30
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:33,042
...she passed an exam to be a
flight attendant.

31
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:39,454
She uses language skills at
work. At school, she was a

32
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:44,620
bright individual but she grew
to be an even a better person.

33
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:47,459
She was a career-oriented woman.

34
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:53,925
It's too bad I have
to say this in past tense.

35
00:04:53,925 --> 00:05:01,104
But, after meeting
her husband today,

36
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,511
I understand why she wants to
leave her career.

37
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:12,319
I'm happy to know he is a kind
and open-minded person.

38
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:25,584
We'd like Yoko to be happy
forever. Congratulations!

39
00:05:52,249 --> 00:06:02,159
Nakayama's brother-in-law
Mimura, will give a speech.

40
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,662
Since his parents passed away
when he was young,

41
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:12,080
his brother is like his parent.
He is also a mentor at work.

42
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,690
My name is Mimura.

43
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:31,684
When I married my wife,
Nakamura was still in school.

44
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:45,578
Are you Mr. Mimura': wife?

45
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,950
Yes, I am. Have we met?

46
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:57,586
My name is Koshiya. I work
with both of them at the school.

47
00:06:57,581 --> 00:07:00,721
Are you a student?

48
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:05,718
Now he works as a translator
and works at a prep school.

49
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:19,405
I wanted to say hello to you.

50
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,680
It's nice to meet you.

51
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:29,147
Having a family will give more
reasons to be successful.

52
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:35,256
Congratulations, Nakayama.

53
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,162
Thank you very much.

54
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,767
Dear...

55
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:51,873
Congratulations.

56
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:03,550
The next speech will be from
the father of the bride.

57
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:04,890
Hi, what's happening?

58
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,759
What?

59
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,821
What are you doing here?

60
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,459
I came to see what the wife
looks like.

61
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,662
Why did you want to see
Nakayama': wife?

62
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,864
No, I came to see your wife.

63
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,168
What?

64
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:34,550
That's all. I'm leaving now.

65
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,369
Please take your mom home.

66
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,431
Dad, where are you going?

67
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:56,070
Shuji, Congratulations.
I'm happy for him.

68
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:10,378
I wanted to see what your wife
looks like.

69
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,082
You had a disguise?

70
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:18,817
I wasn't sure it's worth
seeing or not.

71
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:23,356
Of course, it's not worth it!

72
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:27,268
Here are your glasses... what's
your schedule tomorrow?

73
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,728
I only have a Russian exam.

74
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:33,800
I have a class at 10:00 so
I'll come here by 9:30.

75
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:50,523
Good morning.

76
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,790
Do you want some coffee?

77
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:55,229
Yes, please. This is for you.

78
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,722
Wow, isn't it expensive?

79
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,764
I don't know... 26,200 yen.

80
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:57,941
I should get a teaching
certificate, shouldn't I?

81
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,921
Hmm...

82
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,791
It's hard to get a job even if you
have a 4-year degree...

83
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,093
I agree.

84
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,594
I wonder if there's a nice man
out there...

85
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,832
This is my treat.

86
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:22,838
It was nice to see you at the
reception. What are you doing?

87
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,439
I'm studying for my work.

88
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:28,474
Do you know if they have any
openings at school?

89
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,679
I'm not sure.
I got a referral, so...

90
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:34,713
Yeah, you have a connection.
You are lucky.

91
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:39,057
Don't make it sound easy.
He is respective at work.

92
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,892
I should find someone like him.

93
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:43,490
Someone like him?

94
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,626
Nekomiya, did they say OK?

95
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:49,399
No, they didn't. I'm not as
popular as you...

96
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:54,001
Wow, you eat a lot.

97
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:57,774
Look how healthy I look.

98
00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:01,545
It's scary...

99
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,343
Be serious.

100
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,226
<i>Hmm.</i>

101
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,461
I better go now.

102
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,767
Do you have a date
with him now?

103
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,708
No, I'm going to work.

104
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:33,480
Thank you.

105
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:38,283
You're so naive, Nekomiya.

106
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:57,165
Excuse me, where should I take
this form?

107
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,506
It's for the liberal arts courses?
Please go to this line.

108
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:03,739
Thank you very much.

109
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:11,677
Good morning.

110
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,658
Good morning.

111
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:22,491
Sensei.

112
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,461
This is the exam and
answer sheet.

113
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,996
Thank you.

114
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:34,601
This is a reference note and
helpful guides.

115
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:39,741
They're about auxiliary verbs.
All three are in the future tense.

116
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:45,550
These problems are made to
trick students.

117
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,044
I see.

118
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:54,456
It's interesting...

119
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,328
Please submit it to
the office manager.

120
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,391
OK.

121
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,900
Hello.

122
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,401
This is for you. Thank you.

123
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,179
Certainly.

124
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:05,659
A metaphoric preface doesn't
reflect the writer's true feelings.

125
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,107
How about tautology?

126
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:26,520
My hidden I've is too much to
bear, that I still love her.

127
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,286
His love for her is just
unbearable.

128
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,953
This is an expression of
his true feelings.

129
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:40,094
The use of the previous phase
in this poetry

130
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,597
emphasizes his true feelings.

131
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:50,545
Metaphoric prefaces omit the
writer's true feelings.

132
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:54,448
The entire poetry reflects the
writer's feelings,

133
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:56,918
however, omits other elements.

134
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:09,827
<i>X am sorry. X can'! use the
phone at work to ca“ you.</i>

135
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,432
What? Never mind. You're at
the bar, aren't you?

136
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:22,035
I didn't know you could yell
and get angry, too.

137
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:29,314
Are you a student in my class?
You caught me...

138
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,217
You said you have a mistress?

139
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,984
Teachers are not perfect, either.
We could have mistresses...

140
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,548
You better clean up
your reputation.

141
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:40,585
OK.
I better behave now.

142
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,427
Come with me.

143
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:49,000
There are two types of women.
The ones who I want to have

144
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:53,407
under my umbrella and the ones whom
I want to be under their umbrella.

145
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,840
What's the difference?

146
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,336
Anyone can have a woman.

147
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:04,285
In order to get a woman, I need
to understand how she works.

148
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,254
You want to be the one who
was chosen, don't you?

149
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:08,621
Of course.

150
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:10,785
You don't seem to know these
kind of things...

151
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:29,768
Do you know him?

152
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:34,511
He is the top in his class and wants
to enter Tokyo University.

153
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,384
Thank you very much.

154
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:40,378
Look, a normal person like him
has an umbrella.

155
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:45,554
An ordinary person is boring.

156
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:48,860
I have to explain everything to
a young person like you.

157
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,628
I guess it takes time.

158
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,363
Teach me something easy first.

159
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:58,203
I will give you an intensive course.

160
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,608
- Sake!
- OK.

161
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,924
Are you sure about this?

162
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:20,759
Yes.

163
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,321
This is my mistress': place.

164
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,496
Don't you want me
to meet her?

165
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:35,808
You are strange...

166
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:43,311
Be careful.

167
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:44,910
OK.

168
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,018
Where are we now?

169
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:57,157
I told you we're going to my
mistress': condo.

170
00:20:57,153 --> 00:21:00,293
You told me you wanted to
see the place.

171
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,167
Did I say that?

172
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:08,301
Tell her that I was too drunk to
come home on my own

173
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:12,007
and then ask me, "Isn't this
your house?" 0k?

174
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,813
Don't you think it'd be strange
to say, "Isn't this your house?"

175
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:20,913
Well, don't say anything
then...

176
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:35,864
You never kissed before...?

177
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,033
Of course, I have.

178
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:51,119
Kiss me passionately...
tum me on...

179
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:04,929
I'm not that bad though.

180
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,968
Nice breeze.

181
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:17,740
I painted this picture.

182
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,839
Really?

183
00:22:19,836 --> 00:22:22,578
I gave the picture to her as
a gift 12 years ago.

184
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:25,018
Hmm...

185
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:28,148
I was teaching art classes
at that time.

186
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:31,148
You taught art classes?

187
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,727
Do you have something to eat?

188
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,098
No, I don't.

189
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,103
They're for my store.

190
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:52,546
It must be difficult.

191
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:53,845
Are you a student?

192
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:56,977
Yes, I am. I didn't pass an
exam last year.

193
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:04,815
When I take Mimura's classes,
I improve my skills.

194
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:05,815
Is that so?

195
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:19,304
You can live without him, can you?

196
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:24,802
I don't think they're life or
death issues.

197
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:27,304
You are a fine woman.

198
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,510
Well, you have something to eat.

199
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:50,872
Do you want to eat this?

200
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:57,570
Do want me to take you home?

201
00:23:57,567 --> 00:24:03,882
Since she took you home, she
can go home by herself.

202
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:08,413
Yes, I can go home alone.

203
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:19,595
Please don't bring a girl home
when you're drunk.

204
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:23,696
Are you all right?
Can you go home alone?

205
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,769
I'll take you home.

206
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:34,408
No, you don't need to...
where is an elevator?

207
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:38,313
Tum right.

208
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:56,968
In 1929...

209
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,960
From 1925, rationalization was
increased, unemployment rate

210
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:13,754
was high, and people's
purchasing power decreased.

211
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:57,995
I get paid 700,000 yen a month now.

212
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,465
I'm done with my papers.
Give me half of yours now.

213
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:06,963
Wow, you're fast.

214
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:10,501
What do I spend my money on?

215
00:26:12,502 --> 00:26:19,147
Sake, women, and taxi fare.

216
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:21,588
You think so?

217
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:28,357
You better stop...
you know what...

218
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:37,069
and drink sake less.

219
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:40,740
I work for my sake.

220
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,836
I can't help you
if that's the case...

221
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,710
Are you tired?

222
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:47,682
Yeah.

223
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,479
I'm tired.
Please get ready for bed.

224
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,315
OK.

225
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,245
Come here.

226
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:33,786
Wow, you have a scar here.

227
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:41,217
Appendicitis. Doctors used to
cut an opening bigger. Look...

228
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:56,669
How's her store?

229
00:28:56,666 --> 00:29:02,082
Your woman looks vividly
when she's at her shop.

230
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,677
Did you go to her store?

231
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,779
I just felt like looking...

232
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:11,349
I'm not in love with her.

233
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:14,351
What do you mean?

234
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,856
It's been more than 10 years.
We're like husband and wife.

235
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:27,102
How about me?

236
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:32,046
You are precious to me.

237
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,426
Excuse me, Sensei...

238
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,441
How did it go?

239
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:14,909
I passed the exam.

240
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:18,283
Great!

241
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:23,119
Drink some more.

242
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:24,716
I can't drink any more.

243
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,318
Are you sick?

244
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:29,319
Why?

245
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:34,700
If you can't drink, you must be
sick. You don't drink or smoke.

246
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,694
Only sick people say "can't
drink." You know?

247
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:44,166
Madam, please bring two
bottles of beer.

248
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:47,341
If you are sick,
please don't drink.

249
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:48,974
OK.

250
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:56,685
I'll be responsible for
whatever happens to you.

251
00:32:02,118 --> 00:32:06,999
Why did you ask me out?

252
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:09,833
No, I didn't ask you out.

253
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:24,144
Human nature is mysterious.

254
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,385
It's impossible to be any closer
than this.

255
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:37,126
The most we'd connect is a few
inches, anyway.

256
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:47,198
You're drunk, aren't you?

257
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:53,905
You went to the restroom and
didn't come back for a while.

258
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:57,407
I had to make sure you're all
right. You were on the floor.

259
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,180
What are you talking about?

260
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:06,320
I don't want to go home.
I love you, Sensei.

261
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:14,361
Never mind. You were
sleeping safe and sound.

262
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:35,555
Wow, this is beautiful.

263
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:39,857
We use the best material
so it's expensive.

264
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:40,793
The quality is excellent.

265
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:41,727
How much is it?

266
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,560
It is 483,000 yen.

267
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:45,499
OK. I want to buy this one.

268
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:49,026
Thank you. Where should we
deliver this furniture to?

269
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:56,204
The address is 2-5-19
Yoyogi Shibuya

270
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:57,802
at the Koshiya residence.

271
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,441
2-5-19 is the Koshiya residence,
isn't it?

272
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:04,247
Please wait for a few minutes.

273
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:08,847
Let's buy a house just for
the two of us.

274
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:16,626
Let's buy a house just for
the two of us.

275
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,197
Let's buy a house. Let's buy a house.

276
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:54,660
Here it is.

277
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:08,482
You look good.

278
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:10,508
Stop teasing.

279
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:25,230
Hello.

280
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:34,504
Welcome. Take your time.

281
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,812
Do you know her?

282
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:39,745
Dash.

283
00:35:39,735 --> 00:35:41,112
What?

284
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,049
I was a cafeteria manager when
I was in the military.

285
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:52,522
You weren't an executive?

286
00:35:54,116 --> 00:36:02,763
I had a good time. I wish you
were born 36 years earlier, too.

287
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:04,829
You would have enjoyed it, too.

288
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,447
That's like a legend in the book.

289
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:23,646
No, I don't want to be with
the old man...

290
00:36:23,646 --> 00:36:26,991
Gosh, my daughter is
24 years old now.

291
00:36:36,892 --> 00:36:38,269
You are prettier.

292
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:45,508
Compared to whom?

293
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,144
You said "you are prettier",
didn't you?

294
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,486
No, I didn't. Don't
misunderstand what I said.

295
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,752
What are you doing?

296
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:30,155
I'm writing a textbook for
a publisher.

297
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:32,251
For which publisher?

298
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:34,888
This is for Komeisha. Sensei
introduced me to the publisher.

299
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:36,659
Mimura's referral?

300
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:41,567
I think he is at Kawai prep
school now.

301
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:43,332
OK.

302
00:37:48,364 --> 00:37:51,470
Koshiya.

303
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,413
Please come with me.

304
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:01,520
What are you thinking?

305
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,387
What are you talking about?

306
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:07,555
How long are you going to
continue the relationship?

307
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,894
You think Mimura isn't serious
about me, don't you?

308
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:15,391
Well...

309
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:22,903
It must be hard to have a
brother-in-law like him.

310
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:27,898
I think a part of him is serious
but a part of him is just playing.

311
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:42,591
You'll leave him someday,
so don't play with his feelings.

312
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:46,589
No, we'll be together forever.

313
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:51,334
Why don't you join us.
Let's have a drink together.

314
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:33,075
I heard you quit the prep school.

315
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:37,679
I didn't want to go to the same
school for two years.

316
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:40,711
It was a good school.

317
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:44,623
If I don't pass the exam,
it doesn't matter.

318
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:49,358
If you fail an exam again, you
will waste another year..

319
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:55,699
I have to study and try it again.

320
00:39:56,692 --> 00:40:00,469
How's your college life?

321
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,442
It's not very good.

322
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:09,076
That's for cooking.

323
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:12,541
We don't cook at home anymore.

324
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:16,318
Lately, I eat out often.

325
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:22,296
This style is popular nowadays.

326
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:24,730
It looks good on you.

327
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,757
This color is too sober, isn't it?

328
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:28,962
I like that color.

329
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:34,066
By the way, the girl came to
my shop the other day.

330
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:36,475
I know, she told me...

331
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:44,645
Tell her my shop isn't for
young people.

332
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,752
I think young people like
your shop.

333
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:56,389
Besides, she's my
student at school, that's all.

334
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:04,099
You need to clean your ears, Honey.

335
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:14,775
Mom, it's me. How are you?
Why do you talk so loud?

336
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:23,382
Where am I? I'm at home.
Did you receive a letter?

337
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:30,729
I work at a prep school part-time.
Sensei recommended me

338
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,896
to the school... I create exam
problems. How smart am I!

339
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:52,708
Am I drunk? I think I can
drink like clad.

340
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:57,708
You don't have to hide about
that... Thank you.

341
00:42:27,443 --> 00:42:31,585
I'm not doing anything special.

342
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:54,267
It's raining hard.

343
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:56,174
What a trouble...

344
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:05,682
Hi. I didn't know
you were here.

345
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:15,494
Come in... you'll get wet.

346
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:18,090
I will get you a towel.

347
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:37,613
You are late today.

348
00:44:37,606 --> 00:44:40,849
I had a meeting at work.

349
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:44,984
How is she?

350
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,359
"Dash" is a person who we saw
the other day?

351
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,991
Yes, "Dash" means that
someone who has a spouse

352
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:53,261
plus one on the side.

353
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,895
That means you are "Dash,
Dash", right?

354
00:44:57,893 --> 00:45:00,203
Why do you say that?

355
00:45:00,195 --> 00:45:04,007
That's the truth, isn't it?

356
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:07,276
How can you be so
closed-minded?

357
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:09,277
I don't understand it.

358
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,553
How old are you, anyway?

359
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:25,326
Can you decide to be with just
one person?

360
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:27,797
Why don't you breakup with
one of them for your health?

361
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:32,305
He can handle a double-life...

362
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:40,746
How long can he keep doing
this kind of lifestyle?

363
00:45:40,736 --> 00:45:42,943
He made a commitment
to his women.

364
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:45,645
Hmm...

365
00:45:46,942 --> 00:45:48,478
What he does is morally wrong.

366
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:50,582
Yeah...

367
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,923
I am sorry for you.

368
00:45:57,686 --> 00:46:01,156
What's on your lip?

369
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:02,362
Where?

370
00:46:36,324 --> 00:46:41,467
I just ate dinner.

371
00:46:49,571 --> 00:46:52,609
I'm going home and
get ready for bed.

372
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:57,347
Take this umbrella.

373
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:07,133
Can I borrow some money?
I spent all my money on drinks.

374
00:47:07,122 --> 00:47:08,829
OK, just a minute.

375
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:16,098
I will return it to you
as soon as I can.

376
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:36,193
Did you drink too much?

377
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:44,734
I had a crush on a teacher when
I was in middle school.

378
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:47,730
Was he a literature teacher?

379
00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:50,300
No, he was a music teacher.

380
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:54,543
When I went to his classroom
one day, he gave me a candy.

381
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:59,485
I didn't eat if for a long time
and it got spoiled.

382
00:48:39,981 --> 00:48:42,518
Is that you, honey?

383
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:48,558
You are still awake?
You can't sleep?

384
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:53,557
Every time I try to fall sleep,
my leg bothers me here.

385
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:06,781
Where? Here?

386
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:09,312
No, calf area.

387
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,436
It feels good.

388
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:34,279
It feels good.

389
00:49:58,404 --> 00:50:00,543
Let's go eat lunch together.

390
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:13,825
Well...

391
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:24,168
I think the office manager
knows about you and the girl.

392
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:26,143
Oh, really.

393
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:33,107
What are you going to do?

394
00:50:33,105 --> 00:50:35,085
What do you mean?

395
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,418
Are you going to continue
this relationship?

396
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,753
Are you letting her work
at school?

397
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:48,627
You may not know, but there
are some rumors about you two.

398
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:52,262
I kind of know about rumors.

399
00:50:54,126 --> 00:51:00,771
You need to behave yourself.
Don't be open in public.

400
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:10,748
It doesn't matter.
I don't teach logic at school.

401
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:30,307
My sister is acting weird lately.

402
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:35,507
My wife went to visit her
the other day.

403
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:47,649
She was eating grass and
flowers at a garden.

404
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:52,692
She may know about you
and the girl?

405
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:53,925
I don't so.

406
00:51:53,919 --> 00:51:55,125
Are you sure?

407
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:02,800
I need to take care of Machiko.

408
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:08,536
I try my best... you know?

409
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:16,714
I understand. My sister is
spoiled, but that's the reason...

410
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:21,624
Don't worry about Yumiko.
I'm doing nothing wrong.

411
00:52:22,415 --> 00:52:25,624
I know that.

412
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:55,281
I didn't know your size.
Is it too big?

413
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,723
It is like an engagement ring.

414
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:04,693
I'll buy you a birthstone
next time.

415
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,723
Mimura? I thought it was you.

416
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,962
Hello.

417
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,025
Long time no see.

418
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,195
How have you been?

419
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,795
You never attended our class
reunion.

420
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,397
Nothing has changed.

421
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,771
You look older...

422
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:22,073
I can say the same thing
about you...

423
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,510
Is she your daughter?

424
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,242
Well...

425
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:39,691
My work requires me to go to
dinner... See you later.

426
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,067
Let's get married 50 years
from now.

427
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,635
50 years?

428
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:01,844
All my friends will die so we
can be together.

429
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,909
I will die by then...

430
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,151
We have to hide our
relationship right now.

431
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,462
This may be too big.
It might fit.

432
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:38,650
Is it possible for you to quit
the school?

433
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,521
Work?

434
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:45,789
We have to hide about us at work.

435
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:52,222
Nakayama told you about it,
didn't he?

436
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:56,796
Find something else.

437
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:04,742
I'll find you a good job. You
can teach junior high students.

438
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:10,314
I don't plan to live
50 more years.

439
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,843
Don't give up on us.

440
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,549
...don't give up...

441
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,373
Sony. I'm late.

442
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,210
Where did you get that?

443
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:43,582
I just bought a car. It was a
one-way... hard to drive.

444
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,076
Welcome.

445
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,611
Coffee, please.

446
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,318
Where did you get the money
to buy that?

447
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,724
Loan.

448
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,421
How about a down payment?

449
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,556
I took money out from my savings.

450
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,631
I'm going on a trip.

451
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,464
Where are you going?

452
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,408
I haven't decided where
I'm going yet.

453
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,747
Thank you for waiting.

454
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,852
When I become a boring
woman, you'll leave me.

455
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,625
When will you be back?

456
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,456
I'll be back on Tuesday.

457
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:31,864
Let's get together on Tuesday

458
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:39,432
I may extend my trip.

459
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:43,036
Let's meet here on Tuesday.

460
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:50,213
I'm giving you literature that

461
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:54,417
hasn't been translated to the
modem language.

462
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,516
I thought it wouldn't be fun if
someone translated it for you,

463
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,153
so I gave you the original.

464
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,156
Try to translate it on your own.

465
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:12,002
Please don't ask me.
Sit down alone and work on it.

466
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,373
Have a drink.

467
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:27,016
- Take it.
- Thank you.

468
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,825
You are welcome.

469
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:40,158
Why are you wearing the ring?

470
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,603
Love is blind...

471
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,836
He won't divorce his wife, anyway.

472
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,404
He doesn't need to...

473
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,611
He won't break up with the
other woman, either.

474
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,711
It called "having an affair," isn't it?

475
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,519
You are more stubborn than
I thought.

476
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:05,322
I think so, too.

477
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:11,224
Break up with him.

478
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:30,608
I don't know if I'll be with him
for 50 years.

479
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,912
You must love him...

480
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,159
Don't swallow it.

481
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,168
Where are you going?

482
00:58:57,234 --> 00:59:01,205
The pay is 8000 yen per session.
One session is 90 minutes.

483
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,343
Since you don't have
a teaching certificate,

484
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,316
they don't pay you as much.
I think it's not too bad.

485
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,516
I heard the girl you introduced to us,

486
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,149
is doing pretty well at a
new school.

487
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,049
Is that so?
I was wonted about her.

488
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,892
She is only 20 years old and
was a Student here 5 years ago.

489
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,900
Conjunction Auxiliary verbs...

490
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,443
Let's repeat.

491
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,182
Do you know she isn't
married yet?

492
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,024
She is an old-maid,
isn't she?

493
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:48,257
One more time, please.

494
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:07,680
Conjunction Auxiliary verbs are
as follow...

495
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,059
Lonely - Conjugate this word.

496
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,600
Yumiko.

497
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,436
Do you want to go on
a 100-kilo hike?

498
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,279
A 100-kilo hike?

499
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:13,713
It goes from Honjo to Waseda.

500
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,478
Is Honjo in
the Saitama prefecture?

501
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:17,452
Exercise, Exercise.

502
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,978
There is a car for people who
can't make it to the end.

503
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,890
Let's ask Nekomiya. I'm sure
he wants to go with us.

504
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,884
I haven't seen him lately.
Did you see him?

505
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:29,920
He may be sick.

506
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,297
It's not like him.

507
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,766
Let's go.

508
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,066
Give me the half of
your energy.

509
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:51,982
I saw you in my dream last
night. You were naked.

510
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,886
Naked?

511
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:58,224
You were studying at pool.

512
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,023
A! a pool?

513
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:02,656
You were wearing your
swimming suit inside out.

514
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:08,000
So I said to change it. You
started to change in front of me.

515
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,300
That's funny.

516
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:18,911
And the next scene is at the
second-hand bookstore where we met.

517
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,779
You were looking for
a book naked.

518
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,385
You looked very good.

519
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,750
May I borrow your book?

520
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,226
What kind of a book would you
like to read?

521
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:32,955
Anything you have is fine.

522
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:44,434
This book?
It looks interesting...

523
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:50,605
It's actually a boring one
a philosophy book.

524
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,069
You are right.

525
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,685
I stole this book from here.

526
01:02:58,675 --> 01:02:59,847
Really?

527
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,141
Welcome.

528
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:38,991
May I have cannelloni and
a glass of wine, please?

529
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,115
Your birthday is coming soon,
isn't it?

530
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,215
<i>Don't worry about my birthday.</i>

531
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,591
I'll think of something special for you.

532
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,256
It's OK. I didn't buy a
souvenir for you.

533
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:53,132
No, that's OK.
You came back here.

534
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:55,693
Of course,
I would come back here.

535
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,968
Hello.

536
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,278
I came here early...

537
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,250
I wouldn't come here if I knew
you were with her.

538
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:17,923
We'll meet at 5:30, right?
Please don't be late.

539
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:29,765
Where are we going tonight?
I want to eat something different.

540
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:38,043
I saw a guy in my class.

541
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,638
Remember the one who's top
in our class.

542
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,084
Did you go have coffee?

543
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:49,716
He told me he likes me. I'll go
out with him if we break up.

544
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:52,284
Oh, really...

545
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:53,985
Please break up with me.

546
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:57,060
If he finds out about you,
he won't go out with me.

547
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:02,792
Break up with me.

548
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,039
I'll break up with you now.

549
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:19,578
Why don't you let her go?

550
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,517
Are you all right?

551
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,520
<i>Don't worry .</i>

552
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,468
Your socks got ripped.

553
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,996
No, I am OK.

554
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:12,900
Is the same color OK?
I'll go buy a new one for you.

555
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:50,957
Lonely, Lonely, Lonely...

556
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,469
What happen to your knee?

557
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,506
Look at your socks.

558
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,049
My clothes reflect
my feelings...

559
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,113
Where did you hear the poem?

560
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,315
From somewhere...

561
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:58,996
I forgot to pay my bill...

562
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,525
I paid it for you.

563
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:05,033
I'm sorry.

564
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:12,744
It's OK. I don't think I can go
to the restaurant again.

565
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,408
It was a nice place.

566
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,455
She must be drinking, too.

567
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,271
Please take us to Yoyogi.

568
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:43,708
No, we'll go to Shinjuku.
I want to go to another bar.

569
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,734
I don't have any money.

570
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,713
I know you have more money.

571
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:50,047
Please don't let her drink
that much.

572
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:09,867
Welcome.
Please make yourself at home.

573
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:11,236
Let's drink more.

574
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:29,221
Why don't you drink?
You wanted to drink more.

575
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:33,025
I don't feel bad about...

576
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,423
I want you to stay with me until
tomorow morning...

577
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,989
...making you CW-

578
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:38,993
I don't care where we are.

579
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:40,799
What would you like me to do?

580
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,535
Please make love to me.

581
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,873
You want me now?

582
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:50,244
Yes.

583
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:04,582
Let's go to Nakayama's house.
Let's go... OK?

584
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:10,090
Stand up.

585
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,383
I'm sorry.

586
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:35,349
Did you call your home?

587
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:40,191
No, I told my wife not to pick up
a phone in the middle of the night.

588
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:47,632
I'll call her in the morning.
She wakes up at 5:00 a.m.

589
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,463
You're going to break up with
the girl, right?

590
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,634
You better to break up now.

591
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,777
I have your futon (bed) ready
for you.

592
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:13,217
Thank you. Are you all right?
Let's sleep.

593
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,934
How's he going to talk to his
wife about this situation?

594
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:24,167
I'm not sure...

595
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,402
I wonder if your sister really
doesn't know about his affair.

596
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:05,790
Machiko? It's me. I'm sorry,
but I drank too much last night.

597
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:11,595
I stayed at Shuji's house.
It was too late to call you.

598
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:25,337
Sister? We haven't drunk for a
long time so we were too drunk.

599
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:29,111
I asked him to come to my home.

600
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:51,130
Good morning. This is Yoko.
We're sorry to call you so early.

601
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,760
The two didn't get home until
2:00 a.m. Sorry.

602
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,117
What's wrong with you?

603
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:19,183
I'll be late to work.

604
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,562
Should we call a taxi for you?

605
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,532
No. Thank you for your help last night.

606
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:35,136
Every man has some kind of
women history...

607
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:42,070
This is the beginning of the
Tosa Daily. It's famous.

608
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:52,623
Mimura.

609
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:53,651
I'm sorry to be late.

610
01:20:54,550 --> 01:21:01,024
The exam season is at its peak so
we couldn't cancel the class.

611
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:04,128
Yamashita said he had time to
help out so it worked out well.

612
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:07,265
But...

613
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:17,547
I told him that I'll talk to you
about your work performance.

614
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,282
What do you mean by that?

615
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:25,884
Your teaching style isn't a
good fit for exam prep students.

616
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:39,060
Please hand me a bag
on the board.

617
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,533
Please give me the bag.

618
01:22:50,032 --> 01:22:55,345
This is a key of my mistress s
condo. Throw it away.

619
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:08,261
Each one of you was nice to me
I met a nice person like you, too.

620
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,956
I'm leaving now.

621
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:01,470
Hello, this is the Makimura residence.

622
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:07,811
You are there, aren't you?

623
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,983
Are you calling
the Makimura residence?

624
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:22,159
You better make another one.
I have a spare key.

625
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:36,240
He told me to throw the key...

626
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:51,148
The guy I told you about the other
day, found out about the affair,

627
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,669
so I wanted your advice.

628
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,902
If you like him, you need to be
honest with him.

629
01:25:02,898 --> 01:25:05,174
He should understand.

630
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:10,275
I can't be with him if I'm like
this. I don't like this situation.

631
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:21,016
He won't break up with me.
I can't even go to college.

632
01:25:21,016 --> 01:25:23,792
You need to talk to Mimura
about how you feel.

633
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:35,402
Please throw away the key
like he said.

634
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,377
Dad, answer the phone.

635
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:24,853
Leave the phone alone.

636
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:27,022
Answer the phone.
I can't sleep like this...

637
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,924
Never mind.
Just put futon on top of the phone.

638
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:36,163
Do it yourself.

639
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,303
Why does she keep calling here...?

640
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:01,187
It must be from the woman
at the wedding.

641
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,262
I'm very sorry-

642
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,065
Don't be sorry... please deal
with her now.

643
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:11,833
I'm very sorry

644
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:05,683
Mom, what are you doing?

645
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:21,169
Mom, stop! Stop!

646
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:28,413
Mom!

647
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,185
Machiko...

648
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:45,395
I'm cleaning myself...
It's gross.

649
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:08,449
Do you know what time is it now?

650
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,557
It's 8:30.

651
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:12,884
Thank you very much.

652
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:27,570
Kazu, it's me.
Please open the door.

653
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,702
Kazu, Kazuko.

654
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:37,782
Kazu, it's me.

655
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:49,485
I don't have a key.
Please open the door.

656
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,001
Open the door now.

657
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:30,003
He was good at languages...

658
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:33,063
Your weak point is grammar.

659
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:37,168
You must not have the chance to
study in the past.

660
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:44,549
It takes about three months, but
you'll be better at it.

661
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,921
Thank you. Please help him.

662
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:51,582
Please come to my class
next week.

663
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,122
OK.

664
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:58,197
This is a small gift for you.

665
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:21,278
She's sleeping at home?
That's good.

666
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:26,685
It doesn't seem good.
She is on medication again...

667
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:37,495
Did you get the scar from the
woman on the phone?

668
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:45,875
I can't many him if you're like this.

669
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,438
<i>Don't worry .</i>

670
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:01,417
You should live by yourself.

671
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:25,208
I'm responsible for my wife.

672
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:30,246
Not only responsible, she is
precious.

673
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:34,250
My mother was very mean to her.

674
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:39,722
Before my mother died, she
gave complaint letters to Machiko.

675
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,099
I've heard...

676
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:47,090
My wife needs me. I can't
leave my mistress, either.

677
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,079
We were together since the
woman was 24 years old.

678
01:32:57,972 --> 01:32:59,679
My daughter is the same age now.

679
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:03,053
I've heard about that, too.

680
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:06,150
She has suffered for a long time.

681
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:12,462
I asked her to terminate her
pregnancy in the past.

682
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:18,432
I love both of them...

683
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:21,539
I'm not even angry at you any more.

684
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:28,141
I want you to understand
I don't want to lose you, either.

685
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:33,341
I know I'm selfish.

686
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:55,798
I don't feel well lately.
I need to go to a doctor.

687
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:08,276
How did you know the phone
call was from the woman?

688
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:11,718
Didn't you think it was me?

689
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:16,425
No, I know you won't do that.

690
01:34:16,918 --> 01:34:18,124
<i>Why not?</i>

691
01:34:19,254 --> 01:34:21,825
I know you.

692
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,272
We are over now, aren't we?

693
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:46,485
My daughter may be getting
married. My wife seems happy.

694
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,854
We're remodeling now.

695
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:56,633
My wife could live at the house
without me.

696
01:34:57,892 --> 01:34:59,963
We can rent out a part of the house.

697
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:03,598
You can move in with my wife
when I die.

698
01:35:07,769 --> 01:35:14,880
All three of you can complain
about me and enjoy life together.

699
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:21,356
Don't act like you know
everything. I was too childish.

700
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:28,462
I crossed the line with you.
I shouldn't have done that.

701
01:35:32,427 --> 01:35:34,839
Live 50 years more
50 years more.

702
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:39,237
Too young wasn't an excuse, but
getting old wasn't an excuse, either.

703
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:41,938
Don't tell me... anything.

704
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,759
Now you show me your true colors.

705
01:35:58,653 --> 01:36:01,964
Your reputation is getting low
at school.

706
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:05,836
Nobody respects you at school.

707
01:36:07,462 --> 01:36:09,806
You deserved that...

708
01:36:16,004 --> 01:36:17,074
Yumi...

709
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:28,120
Yumi, Kazu, Machiko. You
always play with our feelings

710
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:30,096
Please leave us alone now.
We are over.

711
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,392
Yumi.

712
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:35,059
You just don't understand...

713
01:36:35,056 --> 01:36:37,969
Don't give me a hard time.

714
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:46,902
I'm going now.

715
01:36:56,511 --> 01:36:59,219
You aren't going.
You are leaving.

716
01:36:59,214 --> 01:37:06,826
Please use the right word.
Fix your tie.

717
01:37:39,821 --> 01:37:43,234
You are awful.

718
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:53,501
She has an autonomic nervous system
disorder. She needs to rest.

719
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:55,534
Is that so?

720
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:58,977
I gave her such a stressful life.
I need to be careful now.

721
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:11,486
She can live with us, especially
after your daughter is married.

722
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,586
I don't plan to get divorced.

723
01:39:15,016 --> 01:39:23,333
My sister knows about your
affairs. It's better to move on...

724
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:34,212
It's better to keep it the way it is.
I don't want to end everything.

725
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:07,836
Let's decipher this poetry and
learn the grammar.

726
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:21,624
They are the same sound but
have different meanings.

727
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:38,267
Do you understand how these
sentences work?

728
01:41:37,558 --> 01:41:42,371
Now we're going to start
a 100-kilo hike to Waseda.

729
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:19,845
Slop!

730
01:42:31,045 --> 01:42:34,049
How long does it take to
get to Waseda?

731
01:42:34,048 --> 01:42:36,050
Probably, it'll be tomorrow afternoon.

732
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:38,326
Tomorrow afternoon?

733
01:42:41,422 --> 01:42:42,400
Hum!-

734
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:44,233
My feet hurt already.

735
01:42:44,225 --> 01:42:47,138
Let's cross the street.
It's green now.

736
01:42:48,596 --> 01:42:49,836
Let's go.

737
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:15,523
I didn't know you were
participating in this walk.

738
01:43:17,525 --> 01:43:22,804
How are you? Sometimes
happy, sometimes blue...

739
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:43,954
Sometimes happy, Sometimes
sad... Issa. Maybe it was Basho.

The end
