1
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,611
Alright turn around

2
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:41,616
Ok!

3
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,264
Cute teddy bear!

4
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:49,354
Happy birthday

5
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,557
Thank you!

6
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,960
That's great.

7
00:00:55,985 --> 00:01:00,338
Teddy bears are expensive. Luckily I found that one lying around outside.

8
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:01,768
Papa shhh!

9
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,744
What?

10
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,502
Nothing

11
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,549
Come on, blow out your candles

12
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,174
Ok?

13
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:12,260
Ready and...

14
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,361
Zombies! WHY!?

15
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:36,147
We've come to expose your fake happiness!

16
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:43,307
No matter how happy you are, you'll be one of us in seconds

17
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:45,916
That's just life!

18
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,986
Mama! Mama!

19
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:10,307
Someone save him!

20
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:14,525
Here

21
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:19,916
You were more worried about this little guy than yourself

22
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:22,697
That kindness is very beautiful

23
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,463
Cause he's my friend!

24
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,194
He's a very sincere bear

25
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,553
He looks cute and has the heart of a samurai

26
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:34,575
I'm sure he'll repay you for protecting him by protecting you

27
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:38,397
He's stretching!

28
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,077
He's yelling!

29
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,444
Little girl, I can talk too

30
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:50,882
And I will repay you as best I can!

31
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:59,342
Please save the teddy bear!

32
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,163
I was hoping you'd ask

33
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:04,358
Nuigulumar!

34
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,588
Nuigulumar Z

35
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,641
Thank you!

36
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,139
I've been searching for this little guy

37
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:55,483
He's my friend so I need to take him with me, sorry

38
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,768
That's ok

39
00:04:57,027 --> 00:05:02,420
In exchange, I'll tell you how this world became full of zombies

40
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,717
It began 5 years ago in space

41
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:12,952
Far away, on the planet Domoho

42
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:19,696
A group of very small lifeforms escaped from the destruction of their planet

43
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:27,844
Searching for a new home, they arrived on Earth

44
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:31,470
Their cotton like forms descended upon the planet

45
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:35,048
Falling... like snow

46
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:52,712
Most of them fell into the ocean or onto the ground and disappeared

47
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:03,439
But their greatest warrior Dumava managed to survive

48
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,087
And drifted into a certain home

49
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,806
There he found the best place for him to live

50
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:25,212
Within a handmade teddy bear

51
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:31,611
A designer named Fuyuko Aiyukawa was making it for her daughter

52
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,533
Hey mama!

53
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:42,322
Don't surprise me like that!

54
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:44,806
Hey mama, what day is today?

55
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:47,252
Hm I don't know

56
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:49,462
It's my birthday!

57
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,478
Hey mama, what are you giving me?

58
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:55,173
You can't just directly ask like that

59
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,298
But

60
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:01,978
When we were still with dad with all the violence, there were never any presents

61
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:09,650
But since you got the divorce I've been wondering what kind of present you'd give me

62
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,603
What a selfish girl

63
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,642
Mama is that...?

64
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:29,353
So cute! A teddy bear!

65
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,806
Thank you mama!

66
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,064
You really do care about me

67
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,142
This is proof!

68
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:40,407
His face looks like it was punched, so I'll call him Punchy!

69
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:42,314
We'll never be apart!

70
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:50,086
At that moment, Kyoko's joy energized the warrior sleeping within

71
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,718
What is this feeling?

72
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:59,048
The energy from this girl needing me is awakening my cells

73
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,244
I lost my home and my purpose, but now I understand

74
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,970
I live to protect this princess

75
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,455
I swear on these button eyes!

76
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:14,361
PRINCESS!!!

77
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:15,798
Huh?

78
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,658
The cotton is still sticking out

79
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:26,330
What, so it wasn't done?

80
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,611
Sorry, I've been so busy

81
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:34,915
It's my first birthday with just us. You could have put me first

82
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,447
Sorry

83
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,650
Hey mama!

84
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:46,673
What is it?

85
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,627
You'll be here soon!?

86
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:53,524
Yeah yeah, that's right. I'm almost there. I know I know

87
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:57,181
Food? I just ate udon so I'm good

88
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:02,774
At that moment, with the worst timing a visitor came to Kyoko's house

89
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,193
Where are you now?

90
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,279
Hey mama, let's live with just to two of us

91
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:08,154
Now?

92
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,654
Thanks for waiting!

93
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,318
It's been a while sis!

94
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:16,068
Yumeko!

95
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:17,553
Sis?

96
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,029
You must be Kyoko

97
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:21,936
Thanks for letting me stay here!

98
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,365
Stay!? What's going on mama!?

99
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,390
Uhm that's...

100
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,207
I'm looking forward to staying with you

101
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,049
Ah! Coffee!

102
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,348
Dangerous!

103
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:40,285
Happy Birthday Kyoko

104
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,722
Ahhh oopsie

105
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,371
What did you do!?

106
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:50,223
Whoa a pretty dangerous human showed up

107
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:54,801
I ended up here, but where did Deparza go?

108
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:58,087
My best friend, Deparza!

109
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,611
Someone called out to me?

110
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,329
Could it be Dumuva?

111
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,569
You survived too?

112
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,295
What's with that getup?

113
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,995
Your parents'd be crying

114
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,984
It's a cosplay club. I hate it too

115
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,616
I betcha like this!

116
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,019
Stop! Help me!

117
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:27,780
Tony, c'mere

118
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,756
An old man with a stuffed animal?

119
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:34,756
You just said several keywords that should never be said to me

120
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,342
And you called me tiny. Take that BACK!!

121
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:52,897
I am the Knitted Vengeance Warrior, Charlie!

122
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:54,327
A monster!

123
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,170
Thank you for saving me!

124
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,077
I don't remember saving anyone

125
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,272
You will become my minion

126
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,303
Dumava

127
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,936
It seems we have taken different paths

128
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:40,423
This is the first step towards my ambition

129
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:55,876
Ugh why do I have to do homework on my birthday?

130
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:59,783
And an essay on my dreams. So lame

131
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,056
My dreams...

132
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:14,236
Until recently it was for papa who always bullied mama to get shot by tanks

133
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:17,501
But they got divorced so that kinda happened

134
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:19,361
Thank goodness

135
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,560
But that lolita woman

136
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:27,826
I don't want to spend a single second with her

137
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:31,654
Mr Tank, chase her out of my house!

138
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:38,425
At least give me my time with mama back

139
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:41,597
What?

140
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,433
What a cute teddy bear!

141
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:56,073
The couple little rough points make it even cuter

142
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:02,675
Hey, why are you cleaning in the middle of the night?

143
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:06,694
Sorry, I always used to do it that way at home

144
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:10,983
And that bear is my present!

145
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,833
The vacuum cleaner! I can't get it off!

146
00:13:17,874 --> 00:13:20,699
Please turn it off! Turn it off!

147
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,310
You are way too clumsy!

148
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,559
What happened?

149
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:28,723
Hey mama, I don't want to live with that thing

150
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,246
You know my parents passed away recently right?

151
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:34,379
She has no other family

152
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:36,528
And I'm sure it will help having her around

153
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,184
They're totally black

154
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,145
Burnt toast at night?

155
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,653
Yumeko? More like Yume-ick-ko

156
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,370
I don't need an unfinished bear

157
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,231
Kyoko!

158
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:55,025
I'm sorry sis

159
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:58,025
I'll leave tomorrow

160
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:01,252
It's ok. I'm glad you came

161
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:07,119
She's going through a lot from the divorce and I can't help her on my own

162
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:11,572
I'm sure you'll be able to help her over time

163
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:16,713
I think the two of you are a bit similar

164
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,522
Really?

165
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:22,944
Yep. Your imaginative sides

166
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:32,856
I didn't think there was anyone like me in this world

167
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:35,968
...with some man.

168
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:37,704
There's no way that's true

169
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:41,392
That's just your lies

170
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,518
Isn't that just your guilty conscience talking?

171
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:49,111
Other than my sister who left home as soon as she could

172
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:52,236
No one in my family paid attention to me

173
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:55,932
I had no friends. I was always alone

174
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,815
Plus I never felt comfortable as a woman

175
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:09,769
I started wearing the boy's uniform to school

176
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:16,839
And I always just watched tokusatsu heroes

177
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:23,561
Heroes secretly fight against monsters to defend justice

178
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,844
I wanted to fight the lonely fight against darkness!

179
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:32,344
But as a woman I couldn't be a hero

180
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:35,437
I didn't want to be a tokusatsu heroine

181
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:38,657
The real me was just a clumsy girl

182
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:45,694
I just happened to read a Gothic Lolita magazine

183
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:50,788
And was shocked by the cute and incredible outfits that went beyond just 'clothes'

184
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,993
How elegant! How charming!

185
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:02,157
I instinctively knew what I wanted to wear, so I made it myself

186
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:27,337
Those were my battle clothes!

187
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,767
I had always walked in the shadows

188
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,846
But now I had discovered myself!

189
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,696
Good afternoon!

190
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:45,642
How is it?

191
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,971
What do you think?

192
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:15,229
But soon after my parents fell ill, and I went back to having no place of my own

193
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:20,416
In the end it was all a sweet dream

194
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,911
I can't get along with Kyoko either

195
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,221
I really am so powerless

196
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,252
You idiot!

197
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,330
The teddy bear talked!

198
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:39,166
That's right. A bunch of stuff happened and now I speak Japanese!

199
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:42,000
My movements are a bit awkward but never mind!

200
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:44,133
This is pretty hard work!

201
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:45,829
Sorry

202
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,094
I was listening all along, but there was nothing sweet there!

203
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,665
You're powerless? You can't become a hero?

204
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,653
You haven't done anything, don't make me laugh!

205
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:59,515
It's soft but somehow it hurt?

206
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:03,515
That's the result of training. Hero training.

207
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,532
I see

208
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:06,997
I'll make you into a hero

209
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:08,239
For the Princess

210
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:11,214
The Princess? Who?

211
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,004
So embarrassing

212
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,050
When you laugh your teeth really come out

213
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,017
I'm talking about Kyoko

214
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:29,446
All that matters is making Kyoko happy

215
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,610
But how?

216
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,567
Sew me up and finish me

217
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:37,778
Yumicko, you!

218
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,216
Me!?

219
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,252
It tickles. It tickles

220
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,533
You're good!

221
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,955
You're stupidly clumsy at everything else though

222
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,713
We're saying that sis sewed you up though

223
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:59,166
Lies are an important part of justice

224
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,143
Shut up and sew!

225
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:12,811
I put the finished Punchy and a birthday card in sis' handwriting

226
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,921
Next to Kyoko's pillow

227
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,796
Oh no, she's waking up!

228
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,210
Punchy!

229
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:28,007
All good

230
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:32,434
His teeth are out again. Pushing his nose up...

231
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:39,887
Mama... sorry

232
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,562
Papa...

233
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:48,750
Kyoko... she's lonely

234
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,273
I understand that feeling

235
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:57,711
Maybe I really can become her friend

236
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:07,887
That's good. Don't rush it. Let the love develop

237
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,887
It seems like a storm is coming after all

238
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,205
Japan's Zombie Incident
Cosplay Girl Bites Men

239
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,399
Thanks for waiting!

240
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,623
This zombie incident is pretty serious!

241
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,491
They say 7 people were bitten and infected by the cosplay girl

242
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:31,944
Nice. Getting bit by a girl is the way to go

243
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,757
If she showed up here, I'd be all for it

244
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,256
Master, you serious?

245
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,029
They're here

246
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,008
What now? If you want to get bit now's your chance

247
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,962
You know what, never mind!

248
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,206
Master save me!

249
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:07,870
It hurts!

250
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,665
Mama thank you

251
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:34,720
For what?

252
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,298
For finishing up Punchy

253
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,391
If you're happy, I am too

254
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:53,181
And actually I have one more present

255
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:55,173
Is that?

256
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,102
Manuscript paper

257
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,274
Kyoko, you have the ability to put your imagination into words

258
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:10,350
When something sad happens, I want you to be able to use that imagination to move past it

259
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:14,803
I want you to use your imagination to overcome harsh realities

260
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:16,889
You can do that

261
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,936
Right Yumeko?

262
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,367
Sorry!

263
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:30,768
You're awful! I told you not to bring Yumicko!

264
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,034
Kyoko, Yumeko is my sister

265
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,486
She is your blood relative too

266
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:39,846
Shake hands

267
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:56,010
What was that?

268
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:59,127
Just for today

269
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,854
Because mama told me to

270
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:08,873
I... am fine with just that

271
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:54,246
What terrible timing!

272
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:56,558
Those are real zombies!

273
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:03,176
Yumicko, run away! I'll save the Princess!

274
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,715
But!

275
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,222
Mama what's going on!?

276
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:10,995
Look out!

277
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:15,542
Yumicko!

278
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:22,972
Owwwwwie!

279
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,456
I knew it would turn out like that

280
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:34,362
Don't!

281
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:03,227
Mama!

282
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,516
I...

283
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:06,548
Sis!

284
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:17,983
Mama! Mama!

285
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:19,444
No way..

286
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,149
Mama... Mama...

287
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:30,655
It's your fault

288
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,397
She was shot protecting you!

289
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,116
Not me...

290
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,265
No! She...

291
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:43,007
I'll never forgive you

292
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,546
I'll never ever forgive you!

293
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,351
Kyoko...

294
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,882
Kyoko!

295
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:05,179
I am always kind to women, but against a super evil zombie, I'm going all out!

296
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,663
All out Punch! All out Hit!

297
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,241
Finishing Fart!

298
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,053
Hurry! Chase the Princess!

299
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:35,514
I'm sorry sis

300
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:51,655
Leave me alone!

301
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,988
PRINCESS!!

302
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:02,309
Kyoko!

303
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:16,149
What Princess?

304
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:18,946
You're as old fashioned as always

305
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:20,477
Who are you!?

306
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:23,024
Could you be... Deparza?

307
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:28,451
I'm afraid that since I've combined with a human I am no longer Deparza

308
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:31,286
I am the Knitted Vengeance Warrior, Charlie!

309
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,988
So you're behind these zombies!

310
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:39,692
But back when we fought together, you weren't evil like this!

311
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:42,449
I changed after seeing the darkness in humans

312
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:46,277
Listen! I will not leave even a single teddy bear alive!

313
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,660
No! I won't let you hurt Kyoko!

314
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,426
Then take my retribution!

315
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:56,613
Through my loyal servants

316
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:03,160
The Psychic, Kill Billy!

317
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,724
Gatling Lolita!

318
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,685
What!

319
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,786
The enemy is a lolita too!?

320
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:15,185
Hmph, comparing me with that shitty lolita makes my goth left arm hurt!

321
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,388
What the heck!

322
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:19,310
What is that esper kid gonna do? Spoon bending!?

323
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,707
Sorry. These aren't for bending!

324
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,097
Die by my spoons!

325
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:34,441
Yumicko! Hurry and dodge!

326
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,977
You will suffer for defying us!

327
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,665
You pink shit!

328
00:28:47,915 --> 00:28:50,134
You're too naive!

329
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:57,290
No!

330
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:58,446
Princess!

331
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,149
Yumicko, leave this to me and run!

332
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,938
No! I failed to protect her!

333
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:09,063
If I can save Kyoko, I don't care if I die!

334
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,848
Don't do it!

335
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:20,192
If I can use my blood to distract them, I can save her!

336
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,630
They're here!

337
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:39,623
You're damn annoying!

338
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:44,701
Yumicko!

339
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:47,521
Are you ok? Hold on!

340
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,832
I don't regret it. My life was meaningless anyways

341
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,512
That's not true

342
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:57,340
As a woman, you have a true samurai spirit

343
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:59,644
You protected her and fought back!

344
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:03,767
Combine with me and become the hero you dreamed of!

345
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,525
Become the hero!

346
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,329
What?

347
00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:14,626
What's wrong Billy? Finish her

348
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,314
I won't kill someone already on the verge of death

349
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,665
Are you disobeying me?

350
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:22,711
Sorry

351
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,178
I can really become a hero?

352
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,203
They won't call me a heroine?

353
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:37,477
I'll do my best. What do you want to look like?

354
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:40,071
Cute and fluffy

355
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:43,156
Make me a teddy bear like you Punchy

356
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:48,758
I want to be strong like that guy who finished me off!

357
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:53,162
And I want my face to look like his too!

358
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:55,451
What about the name?

359
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:59,066
Eh!? What should I... uhm... uhh...

360
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:02,693
Hurry up! We'll hit the ground soon!

361
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,637
It's a stuffed animal so...

362
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,778
Nuigulumar!
(TN: nuigurumi = stuffed animal)

363
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:10,013
Ok! got it!

364
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,017
Who are you?

365
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:47,955
Sharper than cotton and soft to hug. But I don't hug evil.

366
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,721
Nuigulumar arrives!

367
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:54,356
I won't let you touch the Princess!

368
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:13,979
Who is that!

369
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,001
Go!

370
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:15,932
Yes sir!

371
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,801
Curse you!

372
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:46,458
You are a brilliant foe, however...

373
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:51,536
When the time is ripe, we will take our revenge in a horrific fashion!

374
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,247
Remember this

375
00:32:57,521 --> 00:32:58,700
Uhm

376
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,163
Princess, are you hurt?

377
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Who are you?

378
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:09,436
Someone who understands the sadness inside you

379
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,624
I will be praying for the day you are healed

380
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:14,764
Wait!

381
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:23,193
Yumicko

382
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,864
We now have a shared destiny

383
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,724
We will continue to protect her from the shadows, just like sis wanted

384
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,068
Yeah

385
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:35,857
I swear on these button eyes!

386
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:44,080
With that the zombie attacks ceased

387
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:47,860
Charlie disappeared and remained disturbingly quiet

388
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,603
It seemed at first to be resolved

389
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:56,908
But rumours began circling of people becoming zombies due to stress or from catching a cold

390
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:59,228
And a sense of unease continued to spread

391
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:04,689
And so several years passed

392
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:35,703
So noisy!

393
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:44,271
Kyoko! I made dinner, want to eat?

394
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,540
I did it!

395
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,837
Punchy! She took it! Yay!

396
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,923
Um so today I tried making omurice!

397
00:35:06,994 --> 00:35:08,541
You know Yumicko

398
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:12,923
No matter how many times you cook for me, I'll never eat it so it's just a waste

399
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:16,985
That's alright. Making it is my hobby

400
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:20,837
Stop being so polite

401
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:23,157
You're older than me. Pisses me off

402
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:29,219
That brat, she really makes me mad

403
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:31,610
I'd like to turn into Nuigulumar and teach her a lesson!

404
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,125
Hold it in!

405
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,953
If you get too mad you'll explode!

406
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:36,000
Like BOOM!

407
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,172
Listen, she just keeps getting further and further away from me

408
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:41,078
My patience is gonna wear out!

409
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,148
Ow!

410
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,472
If you hug me we'll combine!

411
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:52,059
Ahh! We half transformed!

412
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,246
She's back!

413
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,910
Say something?

414
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,035
Nope, nothing

415
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,481
Oh here!

416
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:04,559
Uh the deadline for the novel submission is coming soon so you should prepare your draft

417
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,340
I'm not writing a novel

418
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,473
I only believe in music

419
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:11,800
I don't care if it was my mom's will, it's stupid

420
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,817
Soy sauce!?

421
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:16,689
I'm amazed you can say that when you let my mom die

422
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,274
But what pisses me off most is that she saved you instead of me

423
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,389
That's-

424
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:27,029
I'm old enough now to understand

425
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,865
No one has ever wanted me around

426
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,420
That's not true!

427
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:32,490
It is!

428
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:35,269
The person who saved me never showed up either

429
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:38,769
I don't need this garbage anymore

430
00:36:38,816 --> 00:36:40,417
Garbage?

431
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,112
I did my best to fix it!

432
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,244
You fixed it?

433
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,314
Sorry...

434
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:50,846
Figures. You and mama lied to me

435
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,799
You're the worst

436
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,025
Oww

437
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:57,479
Punchy we have to go after her

438
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,228
So mean! How could she call me garbage!?

439
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:05,416
The Princess has abandoned me. I'm going to pull out my cotton and die

440
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:06,807
How could she!

441
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:09,381
It hurts!

442
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,756
I might be at my limit living like this.

443
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:17,723
I forgot about work!

444
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Where are you Kouji?

445
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:23,442
MB Company?

446
00:37:23,872 --> 00:37:25,614
Oh it's here

447
00:37:28,293 --> 00:37:30,661
You're performing here?

448
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:32,681
What's your band again?

449
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,705
No, it's not a performance it's a seminar

450
00:37:36,745 --> 00:37:37,899
A seminar?

451
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:42,719
On the surface it's a health and cosmetics company

452
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:47,665
But apparently the president's seminars are amazing

453
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:51,408
Kyoko, hurry up

454
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:56,759
No way, I'm not interested in that religious stuff

455
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,439
No dumbass, it's not religious

456
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,283
It's a seminar

457
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:09,751
Shit, it's Yumicko. She's doing some sort of bike delivery job

458
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:15,580
Kyoko you're late!

459
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:20,219
They say after taking this seminar musicians and performers suddenly became successful

460
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:21,876
Let's check it out!

461
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:27,103
Hey, you're not my boyfriend. I told you no touching

462
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:30,634
Cheapskate. Free sex has always been a part of rock and roll

463
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:36,525
Kouji, you've got a good face and a good smile, but your brain needs work

464
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,712
Your teeth are covered in food too

465
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:40,392
You know, never mind

466
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,064
Seriously?

467
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,494
You two there

468
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,392
Please enter

469
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,666
Those lips...

470
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:57,359
Is he... Nuigulumar?

471
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,317
Well?

472
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:04,654
I'll go! I'm coming!

473
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,177
Nice! Let's go!

474
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,810
President, Kyoko is here

475
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,794
I see. This moment has finally come

476
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,310
Ugh, curry just doesn't fit the lolita style at all

477
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:23,693
I wish Kyoko understood what working was like

478
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:29,333
Excuse me. Your curry is here!

479
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:32,958
Hey Yumicko, is it really ok not to follow the Princess?

480
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,904
I have a bad feeling

481
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:36,865
She can do whatever she wants

482
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,537
You're just being overprotective

483
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:40,192
You fool!

484
00:39:40,226 --> 00:39:43,310
A man protects without expecting anything in return!

485
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,348
I'm not a man!

486
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:50,034
But there's a smell, like some sort of animal

487
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:52,799
Are you talking about me!? I bathe properly!

488
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:56,768
No! I can sense Charlie!

489
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:57,754
Really?

490
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:58,660
Hey!

491
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:02,348
Who are you? You're suspicious!

492
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,434
Damn!

493
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,340
The curry! In my eyes!

494
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,551
Run away!

495
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:09,840
Stop!

496
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,988
So you're saying Charlie is here and Kyoko went in too?

497
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:14,848
Yeah

498
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:18,681
Looks like you need us after all Kyoko

499
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:26,462
There's a lot of artists here but none of them standout

500
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,908
You don't either

501
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:30,595
You suck

502
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:38,345
I am the president of MB Company

503
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:39,993
Charlie Takeshi

504
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:45,346
Are you not dissatisfied with your lives?

505
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:47,205
That's not right

506
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:51,002
You have talent. Everyone around you is an idiot

507
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:53,346
Don't you agree?

508
00:40:55,047 --> 00:41:00,523
But that is only because you haven't unleashed your true power!

509
00:41:02,453 --> 00:41:04,367
Look at me

510
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,648
A man like me who is 4 and a half feet tall (142 cm)

511
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:13,514
Runs a company that brings in 8 billion yen each year

512
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:15,915
And has 4 beautiful women around him

513
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:25,234
All this because of these cells, just like pure cotton

514
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:28,695
And I will share them with everyone

515
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,070
From... my body!

516
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,936
Now, suck them in

517
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:49,991
What's that. Gross!

518
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:51,881
Idiot. This is the happiness mist

519
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:53,162
Breathe it in

520
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:34,186
Is the mist working?

521
00:42:34,397 --> 00:42:39,233
Now you can return to your true forms

522
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,412
For instance, the folk rock guy over there!

523
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:43,600
You mean me?

524
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:46,764
You sing love songs on the street corners

525
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:50,287
But actually you take advantage of people's anxiety!

526
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:52,767
You filthy criminal!

527
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,962
I'll give you a suitable form!

528
00:42:56,231 --> 00:42:57,692
My face is melting!

529
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:07,583
Hey hey, that guy got turned into a zombie! Isn't this bad?

530
00:43:07,608 --> 00:43:09,020
Nah, he just got too excited

531
00:43:11,627 --> 00:43:12,682
Oho?

532
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:16,002
I see a beautiful girl over there

533
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:21,494
What do you see in the mist?

534
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,054
Me?

535
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:26,437
Punchy, we're busting in!

536
00:43:26,462 --> 00:43:27,468
Roger!

537
00:43:37,085 --> 00:43:38,406
She's an intruder!

538
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:39,327
After her!

539
00:43:40,444 --> 00:43:41,943
Close #21!

540
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:47,091
Now, you will see a vision of what you desire!

541
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:51,278
I... want to disappear so...

542
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:53,599
I think I want a castle!

543
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,067
Huh? What's that?

544
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:01,216
Why is it so blurry?

545
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,395
Someone is there?

546
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,669
It's me?

547
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:08,880
And... Yumicko!?

548
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:13,167
Why am I in a swimsuit!? And a watermelon?!

549
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:16,339
That's good! You can split it!

550
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,971
Why am I splitting watermelons with Yumicko!?

551
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:26,110
And I look like I'm having way too much fun?

552
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:31,383
Good luck with your novel Kyoko! We have watermelon too!

553
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,798
And I've started writing a novel?

554
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,157
Happily?!

555
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:40,204
There's no way!

556
00:44:40,618 --> 00:44:42,798
This is what you really want

557
00:44:42,823 --> 00:44:45,204
No no no. No way!

558
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:46,467
It's all lies!

559
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,748
What a scam. You tiny fraud!

560
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:51,100
You called me tiny!?

561
00:44:51,512 --> 00:44:52,725
It's an intruder!

562
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,670
Catch her!

563
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:03,388
An office?

564
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:05,818
The intruder! Hold it right there!

565
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:09,638
I'm trapped!

566
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:15,748
Farting is embarrassing! Too embarrassing!

567
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:17,943
I'm so embarrassed

568
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,740
Alright!

569
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:21,765
I was so embarrassed

570
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:26,201
Playtime is over!

571
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:27,397
Get moving!

572
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:31,623
Koushi!

573
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,568
I... I can't move!

574
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:35,868
Pull yourself together!

575
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:39,759
From now on this is your home!

576
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,361
Hey!

577
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:50,454
Don't leave me behind!

578
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:53,759
What's that? It's like smoke?

579
00:45:55,384 --> 00:45:56,665
My face is burning

580
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:00,189
They're all turning into zombies!

581
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:02,189
This is bad Kouji. Let's run!

582
00:46:06,876 --> 00:46:08,728
What's this door!?

583
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:10,032
Kouji!

584
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:17,650
The zombies are coming! They'll make me one too!

585
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:21,048
Kouji!

586
00:46:21,352 --> 00:46:23,181
Oww! It hurts!

587
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:24,400
Kouji!

588
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,051
If someone was going to bite me

589
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,981
I'd want it to be you

590
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:34,538
Kyoko, take my base as a memento

591
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,108
Kyoko!

592
00:46:38,116 --> 00:46:41,741
We've long been waiting to welcome you

593
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,350
By force!

594
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:47,761
Oww!

595
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:50,644
But that was my memento

596
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,103
Sorry!

597
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:56,009
Kyoko? Kyoko!!

598
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:00,333
You ok?

599
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:04,056
Billy, Kyoko is trying to escape. Catch her

600
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:05,087
Got it

601
00:47:08,516 --> 00:47:09,719
Where are we?

602
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,345
We've ended up in some strange place with no one around

603
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:14,712
No! Someone is here!

604
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:23,360
Manga is so fun!

605
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,306
We can just do our work some other time

606
00:47:26,712 --> 00:47:29,103
Eww who are these people?

607
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:33,821
We're the manga slacker family, and this is our meeting place

608
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:37,735
Manga slacker family?

609
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:43,218
Thanks to the seminar, we realized that lying around reading manga is way better than working

610
00:47:43,663 --> 00:47:46,016
We're all failures at life anyways

611
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:49,985
Let's just ignore them and go

612
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:50,954
Yeah

613
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,037
That teddy bear is looking down at us!

614
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:57,076
Unforgivable!

615
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:03,365
They're reading manga while rolling after us!

616
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,717
And they're fast!

617
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,881
Now they've started break dancing! That's really disturbing!

618
00:48:13,906 --> 00:48:17,334
Not good! This is bad! Dangerous!

619
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:32,913
He's here!

620
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:36,780
You really did come for me!

621
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,569
I always believed you'd come save me!

622
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:42,132
I always wanted to meet you again!

623
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:54,243
Nuigulumar! I wanted to see you!

624
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:57,478
Did she say Nuigulumar?

625
00:48:57,602 --> 00:49:00,243
Princess... that's a terrible mistake

626
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:03,431
Yumicko!

627
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,689
That's...!

628
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:07,406
Good to see you

629
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,275
Hey!

630
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,634
What am I saying...

631
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:12,383
Stop bothering me

632
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,361
What are you doing here? It's dangerous!

633
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,454
Dangerous? I came because I was worried!

634
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:18,961
I skipped work...

635
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:20,398
That's not fair!

636
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:22,740
I see..

637
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,599
Well sorry, I was insensitive

638
00:49:26,624 --> 00:49:28,232
Now hurry and run!

639
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:29,185
Let's go!

640
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,240
And you're older than me so stop being so polite!

641
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:36,188
What's wrong? Hurry up!

642
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,062
Yumicko? Yumicko!

643
00:49:39,452 --> 00:49:40,937
[Shonen Attack]

644
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,109
Hurry up Yumicko!

645
00:49:44,134 --> 00:49:46,085
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

646
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,554
I'm jealous. You have someone who cares for you

647
00:49:48,937 --> 00:49:50,421
I don't have anyone like that

648
00:49:54,421 --> 00:49:57,054
This is bad Yumicko. They're back!

649
00:49:58,149 --> 00:49:59,569
Why I wonder...

650
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:01,700
It was such a shock

651
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:06,934
I've never seen Kyoko make a happy face like that before

652
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:17,284
So long as I was Nuigulumar, I thought Kyoko would never show me a face like that

653
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:21,223
I want to smash everything!

654
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,817
NUIGULUMAR!!!

655
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,609
What? What is this feeling?

656
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:43,312
What's happening?

657
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:04,315
President, I brought Kyoko

658
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:10,415
So we meet again, dear Kyoko

659
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:12,447
Don't call me dear

660
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:14,728
Don't make that face. So cold.

661
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:15,986
Billy, you too

662
00:52:16,229 --> 00:52:17,642
That's not true

663
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,073
Billy, do you not agree perhaps?

664
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:24,392
With dear Kyoko becoming my wife?

665
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:28,776
What? Me? Your wife!?

666
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,706
So lucky!

667
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,815
We are all so jealous!

668
00:52:36,425 --> 00:52:40,018
President! I was the first to pledge my loyalty to you!

669
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:41,706
I'll be your one and only wife!

670
00:52:41,731 --> 00:52:42,690
Oh?

671
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:50,464
I don't remember making you my wife

672
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:52,897
A bullied girl on the brink of suicide

673
00:52:53,388 --> 00:52:55,878
You should be happy enough that I made you a warrior!

674
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,198
I am forever grateful!

675
00:53:00,808 --> 00:53:02,393
Remember that mist you breathed in?

676
00:53:02,418 --> 00:53:05,878
When women inhale it they become hopelessly attracted to me

677
00:53:06,112 --> 00:53:07,503
Isn't that right?

678
00:53:07,753 --> 00:53:09,104
Yes!

679
00:53:09,129 --> 00:53:10,925
He's an amazing man

680
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:13,276
There's no way!

681
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:18,849
I've... never fallen in love

682
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:21,554
Not with anyone

683
00:53:25,278 --> 00:53:26,685
Help me

684
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,322
Damn I'm pissed!

685
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:35,854
That surprised me!

686
00:53:36,265 --> 00:53:38,987
Where is this? Where is Kyoko!

687
00:53:39,012 --> 00:53:40,237
Where's Punchy?

688
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:43,940
This is MB Company's surveillance room

689
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,387
Soon our plan to use all these brainwashed humans will begin

690
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:50,684
Plan? What are you going to do!?

691
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,051
I'll take over expwaining from here!

692
00:53:56,846 --> 00:53:58,081
A baby?

693
00:53:58,293 --> 00:54:00,831
I am the baby human, Hajime!

694
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:05,759
I once wanted to become terrorist

695
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,651
But now I've become the most harmwess of cweatures

696
00:54:09,676 --> 00:54:11,338
Harmless? Really?

697
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:13,203
Big sis

698
00:54:13,237 --> 00:54:19,049
Soon I'm gonna rewease a lot of zombies into Tokyo

699
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:22,573
It will be sooo twagic

700
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,994
Zombies into the city?

701
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:32,698
No one could do something so horrible!

702
00:54:32,723 --> 00:54:34,854
But he can do it

703
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:37,737
Babies are so innocent after all

704
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,338
Hajime, I'll show you something good

705
00:54:42,682 --> 00:54:44,486
So press the button!

706
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,799
Ok!

707
00:55:01,476 --> 00:55:02,890
Oh no!

708
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,773
All that's left is the button for the front entrance

709
00:55:12,313 --> 00:55:14,843
But Punchy and Kyoko are both in danger too

710
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:17,437
Who will you save?

711
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:20,492
You coward!

712
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,552
Now, come on

713
00:55:27,086 --> 00:55:29,263
Pretty!

714
00:55:30,075 --> 00:55:31,754
Come on

715
00:55:35,555 --> 00:55:37,555
The mist is working now

716
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:40,880
Now, let's begin the marriage

717
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:42,708
First...

718
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,001
I met someone named Yumicko here

719
00:55:49,029 --> 00:55:51,601
Could you let her go?

720
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,282
What a coincidence

721
00:55:53,578 --> 00:55:56,610
I've got someone connected to her here

722
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:02,975
Here!

723
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:06,270
That's!

724
00:56:06,785 --> 00:56:08,161
Punchy!

725
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:11,477
Princess, I'm sorry you are seeing me like this!

726
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:14,001
I couldn't protect you!

727
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,837
It talked!?

728
00:56:15,862 --> 00:56:18,860
Listen, as proof of our love

729
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:23,063
I want you to execute that monster with your own hands

730
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:24,454
Execute!?

731
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:32,667
My hand is moving on it's own!

732
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:35,667
Shoot him. Blow him to bits!

733
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,629
Deparza why!?

734
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,551
Why do you have so much hate towards humans!?

735
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:49,160
I hate their shallowness

736
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:54,918
Never mind upbringing, even just from the size or position of the eyes, a human's fate can be determined.

737
00:56:55,877 --> 00:56:58,636
I felt sad for Takeshi

738
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,128
Takeshi lived in poverty with his uncle

739
00:57:20,494 --> 00:57:22,331
One day, he stole his uncle's money

740
00:57:24,214 --> 00:57:26,065
And bought a knitted teddy bear

741
00:57:33,144 --> 00:57:34,792
As a present

742
00:57:34,817 --> 00:57:36,526
For a girl he had a crush on

743
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:47,587
But

744
00:57:47,612 --> 00:57:48,995
It was a trap

745
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:05,763
While this happened

746
00:58:05,788 --> 00:58:07,420
The cotton like alien descended

747
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:19,029
They combined

748
00:58:19,054 --> 00:58:20,475
And became a knitted teddy bear!

749
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,402
Their purpose:

750
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:50,965
To bring disaster to all humans!

751
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:03,637
If I'm unhappy, I'm going to make all of humanity equally unhappy!

752
00:59:03,662 --> 00:59:06,145
Using all the power I have attained!

753
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:08,411
Now, execute him Kyoko!

754
00:59:18,384 --> 00:59:22,250
Princess, you are just being deceived by the mist

755
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:25,132
Focus your imagination on your true feelings

756
00:59:26,055 --> 00:59:28,484
Overcome your own thoughts!

757
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:30,071
Imagination?

758
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:41,829
That's right. To me that teddy bear was...

759
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,024
Proof of love

760
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:49,139
The ones who made it were mama and...

761
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,787
Yumicko

762
00:59:57,444 --> 00:59:58,904
Punchy!

763
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:00,863
I can't!

764
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:02,621
No!

765
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:04,168
What are you doing Kyoko!?

766
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:06,152
I don't love you

767
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:12,980
Yes! Thanks!

768
01:00:13,005 --> 01:00:14,379
Nice moves!

769
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:16,402
You betrayed me!

770
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,730
This debt may be repayed later

771
01:00:21,572 --> 01:00:25,120
But I don't want to be part of a creep's plans

772
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:29,698
Until now, my life may have been dictated by my powers

773
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:32,949
But from now on, I live my own life!

774
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:35,191
Traitor!

775
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:46,771
Let's go!

776
01:00:50,654 --> 01:00:52,581
Emergency. Emergency.

777
01:00:52,606 --> 01:00:53,753
Billy has escaped

778
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:55,159
Capture him immediately

779
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,167
Emergency. Emergency.

780
01:00:57,192 --> 01:00:58,542
Billy has escaped

781
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:01,598
Miss Lolita, Billy has escaped

782
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:05,138
Damn, that bitch Kyoko ran off

783
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:08,747
What'll you do? You must be worried to death

784
01:01:08,772 --> 01:01:10,458
That's not true!

785
01:01:10,973 --> 01:01:11,958
Huh?

786
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,318
Kyoko has the strength and kindness to stand up for herself

787
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:20,419
I believe in her!

788
01:01:21,002 --> 01:01:23,002
That kinda pisses me off

789
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,885
Hajime, time to make you a maniac

790
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,910
Huh? A maniac?

791
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,609
A beauty is eating messily. That's your fetish right?

792
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,369
Don't get worked up over that!

793
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:41,905
Oh no! I accidentally got some on my boobs!

794
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:50,319
No!

795
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:21,981
The zombies are dancing to the beat!

796
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:26,028
The whythm makes them more viowent!

797
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:29,044
It's hell's Awa Dance Festival dance

798
01:02:29,224 --> 01:02:30,575
Awa Dance Festival?

799
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:33,676
There's an Awa Dance Festival event happening nearby

800
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,701
The tragedy will start there!

801
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:40,572
Then I'll do the Awa Dance too!

802
01:02:51,205 --> 01:02:52,720
You ok Yumicko?

803
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:00,556
Little baby, it's nappy time!

804
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:10,634
This is terrible!

805
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:18,837
I'm so excited we're getting a new shopping mall here!

806
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:22,092
Me too, it's great that they're hosting this Awa Dance Festival for the opening

807
01:03:22,117 --> 01:03:24,103
And J.A. is doing an action show too!

808
01:03:24,128 --> 01:03:26,033
Really? An action show!

809
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,869
My chest feels so hot

810
01:03:38,894 --> 01:03:39,900
Let's do our best!

811
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:40,697
Yeah!

812
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,882
It sounds like the Awa rhythm, and it's getting closer

813
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:53,804
What's that!?

814
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:56,538
The dead are dancing towards us!

815
01:04:43,397 --> 01:04:44,702
Kyoko

816
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,124
What is it?

817
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,952
There's something I have to tell you

818
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:53,608
I am not a man

819
01:04:54,552 --> 01:04:55,763
I'm a woman

820
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,005
Yes, I know

821
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,505
And... I'm not Nuigulumar

822
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,864
Then who is?

823
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:10,285
That person you call Yumicko. I attacked and injured her before

824
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:12,989
No... I may have killed her

825
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,348
What do you mean?

826
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:20,142
But she revived, in order to save you

827
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:31,314
We need to quickly escape and deal with the situation outside!

828
01:05:31,548 --> 01:05:34,986
I know, but there's one thing I have to settle first

829
01:05:35,267 --> 01:05:36,924
I can't fight otherwise

830
01:05:42,282 --> 01:05:44,579
Take all of this you traitor!

831
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:46,896
Go ahead first! I'll follow after!

832
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:48,109
Hurry!

833
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:49,994
Don't try and act cool!

834
01:05:53,893 --> 01:05:54,893
Billy!

835
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:57,736
It's nothing! Hurry up and go!

836
01:06:07,086 --> 01:06:09,142
Yumicko! Save Billy!

837
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:13,720
Coming to me only when you need my help is a bad habit you know.

838
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,117
I want to talk with you as equals

839
01:06:21,142 --> 01:06:23,963
So I won't be so polite anymore, Kyoko

840
01:06:25,096 --> 01:06:26,338
Yumicko...

841
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:32,131
I'm not protecting you because sis asked me to

842
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:35,193
It's frustrating but...

843
01:06:37,148 --> 01:06:38,889
It's because I love you

844
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:44,600
Punchy, Billy and sis are the same

845
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:50,177
So thinking that no one wants you

846
01:06:50,998 --> 01:06:52,779
Is just selfish and childish

847
01:06:54,912 --> 01:06:57,061
Be more honest with yourself

848
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:01,893
If you need help, say it properly

849
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,636
Help me

850
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:12,151
More politely

851
01:07:19,097 --> 01:07:25,798
Deep down, I knew that I had already accepted you for a long time now

852
01:07:29,704 --> 01:07:31,063
I'm sorry

853
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:36,587
So please, save Billy!

854
01:07:37,649 --> 01:07:39,649
I don't care what happens to me

855
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,368
Please!

856
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,669
Ok

857
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,473
Nuigulumar!

858
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:26,048
Here we go!

859
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:32,954
You bitch!

860
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:38,509
You damn bitch!

861
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:42,696
This is how it should be, mama

862
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:44,657
It's not over yet!

863
01:08:58,391 --> 01:09:00,844
If you don't hold on tight you'll fall

864
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:03,134
I know that

865
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:05,587
I've always wanted to

866
01:09:10,936 --> 01:09:12,061
Get ready

867
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,199
I'm so happy for you two

868
01:10:15,012 --> 01:10:16,316
We've arrived

869
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:17,699
Thank you

870
01:10:19,652 --> 01:10:20,980
Billy!

871
01:10:21,574 --> 01:10:24,136
Are you ok? Hang on Billy!

872
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:25,504
Somehow...

873
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:28,246
Yumicko

874
01:10:29,034 --> 01:10:31,425
I'm going to go do what a hero must do

875
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:33,379
We're going Punchy!

876
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:34,988
Roger Yumicko!

877
01:11:33,113 --> 01:11:35,801
Excuse me, this one is very cute

878
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:39,199
Yes that is our most popular item at the-

879
01:12:06,683 --> 01:12:08,243
Help me!

880
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:10,688
Excuse me! Please, I need help! Hey!

881
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:17,344
Stop!

882
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:26,868
The proper etiquette for those who have died once is not to trouble the living

883
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:30,290
If you can't accept that, I'll be your opponent!

884
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:39,523
Damn

885
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:40,609
Punchy!

886
01:13:40,634 --> 01:13:42,258
Roger! Yumicko!

887
01:13:43,537 --> 01:13:45,186
Nuigulumar!

888
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:26,686
She did it!

889
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:28,014
Nuigulumar!

890
01:14:28,491 --> 01:14:29,795
Yumicko!

891
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,383
Damnit, that Nuigulumar bitch

892
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,602
Will you all make Nuigulumar suffer for me?

893
01:14:43,836 --> 01:14:45,360
Of course!

894
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,243
Why?

895
01:14:50,392 --> 01:14:53,313
I wasn't asking you. You keep screwing up

896
01:14:53,338 --> 01:14:54,766
I'm done with you

897
01:14:55,243 --> 01:14:56,555
But I loved you...

898
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,580
Then we'll be going

899
01:14:59,906 --> 01:15:02,391
Hey! Hey, you ok?

900
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,633
Lolita? Hey!

901
01:15:04,658 --> 01:15:05,790
Lolita!

902
01:15:05,815 --> 01:15:07,048
Leave her!

903
01:15:07,073 --> 01:15:08,637
You are too soft

904
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:22,289
You should just be silent and combine with me Deparza

905
01:15:27,793 --> 01:15:29,941
I will finish this myself

906
01:15:33,584 --> 01:15:35,363
Worthless insects

907
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:37,925
I will exterminate you all at once

908
01:15:48,748 --> 01:15:52,798
Now, let's activate our given power!

909
01:15:52,823 --> 01:15:54,222
Yes!

910
01:15:59,363 --> 01:16:00,745
Embarrassing...

911
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,206
Really embarrassing

912
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:03,081
Same

913
01:16:03,106 --> 01:16:04,550
Incredibly embarrassing...

914
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:12,494
Embarrassing...

915
01:16:14,462 --> 01:16:18,384
I've been charged full of embarrassment energy!

916
01:16:18,955 --> 01:16:20,955
Let's get more embarrassed

917
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:22,596
No...

918
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:25,283
I hate this. This is awful

919
01:16:26,554 --> 01:16:28,913
Our power is fully charged

920
01:16:29,226 --> 01:16:31,835
Everyone, pour the power into your breasts

921
01:17:14,441 --> 01:17:16,754
This is too awful

922
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:20,379
They stripped... Look out, they're coming this way!

923
01:17:20,614 --> 01:17:21,903
Not good

924
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:24,075
Run! Run!

925
01:17:31,372 --> 01:17:33,676
A laser attack too? That's not fair!

926
01:17:38,144 --> 01:17:39,770
Yumicko!

927
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:53,590
Kyoko!

928
01:17:56,825 --> 01:17:59,934
What do you think? Now I can fly!

929
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,887
Charlie you bastard!

930
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:10,848
You shit!

931
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:14,933
You toyed with my fucking maiden's heart!

932
01:18:17,433 --> 01:18:18,606
Look out!

933
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,940
How dare you!

934
01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:31,158
I can't. We can't transform anymore

935
01:18:31,346 --> 01:18:34,393
You cannot stop me

936
01:18:34,453 --> 01:18:36,778
When this secret weapon on my back explodes

937
01:18:36,811 --> 01:18:40,896
All of humanity will die miserably!

938
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:43,557
Why not just let them live?

939
01:18:43,767 --> 01:18:47,189
Just because you are unhappy? That's stupid!

940
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:50,722
Everyone has problems. They work hard to move past them!

941
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:52,433
I don't care!

942
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:55,785
Deparza! Please, show yourself!

943
01:18:56,016 --> 01:18:59,034
Regain your noble warrior spirit!

944
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:01,566
Deparza is gone

945
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:04,228
He died within me!

946
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:06,253
What? No! You're lying!

947
01:19:06,278 --> 01:19:08,946
He's alive! Aliiive!

948
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:12,814
Within minutes, you will all be dead

949
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:18,384
No, I won't let you

950
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:20,486
Even if it's impossible!

951
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:47,501
I will defeat Charlie

952
01:19:47,526 --> 01:19:49,978
Even if it's impossible, I will chase after him

953
01:19:50,478 --> 01:19:54,118
For Kyoko, and for everyone

954
01:19:54,377 --> 01:19:56,650
I'll make the impossible possible!

955
01:20:04,188 --> 01:20:05,478
Yumicko

956
01:20:06,228 --> 01:20:09,626
At an important time like this, I can't do anything

957
01:20:10,001 --> 01:20:11,712
That's not true

958
01:20:12,103 --> 01:20:14,962
We need to find his weakpoint

959
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:16,251
Weakpoint?

960
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:21,163
There!

961
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:30,596
Use this guitar to control the zombies!

962
01:20:30,621 --> 01:20:32,385
Me!?

963
01:20:33,883 --> 01:20:35,719
I've never played live before

964
01:20:36,429 --> 01:20:38,281
But I guess I have to!

965
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:58,727
More! More violently!

966
01:20:58,752 --> 01:21:00,188
Put your heart into it!

967
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:14,829
More! With feeling!

968
01:21:50,878 --> 01:21:52,635
Thank you Kyoko!

969
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,252
We did it! The zombies stopped!

970
01:21:58,557 --> 01:22:01,001
But, now what do we do?

971
01:22:01,026 --> 01:22:03,026
You have a talent for writing right?

972
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:07,487
Try and release your imagination. I'll turn that image into reality

973
01:22:08,108 --> 01:22:10,979
Turn imagination into reality?

974
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:12,416
That's right

975
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:15,593
I'll try

976
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:19,851
Now, picture it

977
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:27,421
When something sad happens, I want you to be able to use that imagination to move past it

978
01:22:27,645 --> 01:22:29,377
You can do that

979
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:38,931
Stop!

980
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:45,572
I still believe! My friend is still alive inside him!

981
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:49,947
Look out!

982
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:59,260
Yumicko once more transforms into Nuigulumar

983
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:04,642
With all of us together, I know she can do it

984
01:23:05,688 --> 01:23:08,416
I will make her transform

985
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:12,002
Keep going. Imagine the future you want

986
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:24,153
Yumicko into Nuigulumar

987
01:23:24,848 --> 01:23:26,520
Together

988
01:23:27,557 --> 01:23:29,442
Together

989
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,630
What was that!?

990
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:40,833
Deparza stop!

991
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,692
Dumuva, I feel the same!

992
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:46,129
If I'm going to combine, I want it to be with you

993
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:49,231
Deparza!

994
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:50,786
Come back to me!

995
01:23:51,672 --> 01:23:54,110
Dumuva, I'm coming!

996
01:23:54,135 --> 01:23:55,555
No, Deparza!

997
01:23:56,242 --> 01:23:58,367
Deparza!

998
01:23:58,392 --> 01:24:01,733
Dumuva, here I come!

999
01:24:03,865 --> 01:24:05,139
Welcome back!

1000
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,967
I'm back. I'm so happy

1001
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:09,421
Deparza!
Dumuva!

1002
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:10,475
I'm happy too

1003
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:13,522
I missed you

1004
01:24:35,952 --> 01:24:37,811
Yumicko will definitely win

1005
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:40,108
She won't lose to him

1006
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:44,014
She too has wings

1007
01:24:49,602 --> 01:24:53,611
And... She can fly!

1008
01:25:09,423 --> 01:25:11,048
That hero's name...

1009
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,751
Her name is...

1010
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:16,610
Nuigulumar!

1011
01:25:17,306 --> 01:25:18,454
Z!

1012
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:00,945
I won't let you!

1013
01:26:10,204 --> 01:26:13,509
We maidens shall be forever!

1014
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:16,954
I'm a goth till I die!

1015
01:26:20,587 --> 01:26:21,736
Lolita!

1016
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:10,470
Oh no! The bomb, that was close!

1017
01:28:35,605 --> 01:28:37,652
Kyoko, I won't lose

1018
01:28:39,229 --> 01:28:43,401
Dear friends wandering through space, lend us your strength!

1019
01:28:43,979 --> 01:28:46,042
Please, join with us!

1020
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:48,067
My friends!!!

1021
01:28:57,566 --> 01:28:58,777
Everyone...

1022
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:08,155
Damn!

1023
01:29:09,381 --> 01:29:12,647
Everyone disappear!

1024
01:29:13,428 --> 01:29:14,749
I won't let you!

1025
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:18,857
Rolling Punchy Deparza Attack!!

1026
01:29:51,613 --> 01:29:55,153
Curse you!

1027
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:17,785
My friends, the cotton alien lifeforms

1028
01:30:18,321 --> 01:30:23,181
You got rid of Charlie and the bomb didn't you?

1029
01:30:24,635 --> 01:30:27,853
You sacrificed yourselves and protected us

1030
01:30:28,447 --> 01:30:29,759
Thank you

1031
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:48,399
She did it!

1032
01:30:48,424 --> 01:30:52,619
Nuigulumar... Yumicko and Punchy won!

1033
01:30:52,978 --> 01:30:54,463
They did it!

1034
01:30:58,459 --> 01:30:59,572
Billy!

1035
01:31:00,198 --> 01:31:02,198
Billy hang on!

1036
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:03,478
Billy!

1037
01:31:04,057 --> 01:31:06,057
Are you ok? Billy!

1038
01:31:08,055 --> 01:31:10,430
It wasn't pointless was it?

1039
01:31:11,149 --> 01:31:14,250
My being born into this world. Kyoko

1040
01:31:15,632 --> 01:31:16,852
That's right

1041
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:20,039
You saved everyone

1042
01:31:23,452 --> 01:31:25,157
Thank you

1043
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:30,759
I'm so glad I met you

1044
01:31:35,951 --> 01:31:37,345
Billy!

1045
01:32:06,391 --> 01:32:07,431
Let's...

1046
01:32:09,324 --> 01:32:10,376
Go home

1047
01:32:31,906 --> 01:32:36,430
After that, Kyoko fulfilled her mama's wish and wrote a book

1048
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:43,114
That story which was based on her experiences won the grand prize in the teen novel contest!

1049
01:32:51,897 --> 01:32:53,441
I made myself a big salad!

1050
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:58,005
Punchy is late

1051
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:00,731
Yes, he is. It's your birthday and your prize winning celebration too!

1052
01:33:01,613 --> 01:33:04,816
Yuckyko, you did give him the right address, right?

1053
01:33:04,848 --> 01:33:06,629
You are pretty ditzy

1054
01:33:06,654 --> 01:33:09,222
Who's ditzy! I told him the right place

1055
01:33:09,247 --> 01:33:10,480
We'll see

1056
01:33:16,964 --> 01:33:19,339
Should I stop calling you Yumicko?

1057
01:33:20,331 --> 01:33:21,620
It's fine!

1058
01:33:22,065 --> 01:33:26,315
It's a good memory now, and I'm just happy you are doing your best

1059
01:33:30,214 --> 01:33:32,331
Hey, you serious?

1060
01:33:32,778 --> 01:33:34,275
I'm going on a journey.

1061
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:37,159
They've made up now, so it's a good opportunity

1062
01:33:37,184 --> 01:33:38,112
I see

1063
01:33:38,473 --> 01:33:40,473
If you are going, I will go with you

1064
01:33:41,263 --> 01:33:43,541
Really!? Great!

1065
01:33:43,978 --> 01:33:46,970
Yumicko and the Princess don't need teddy bears anymore

1066
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:50,878
And if they ever do need us, we'll appear and combine

1067
01:33:52,839 --> 01:33:54,331
So manly

1068
01:33:57,862 --> 01:33:59,589
Don't move! This is a stick up!

1069
01:33:59,614 --> 01:34:00,854
Gimme all your money!

1070
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:03,190
A robber!

1071
01:34:03,215 --> 01:34:05,870
Oh no! Let's go Punchy!

1072
01:34:06,495 --> 01:34:08,229
Roger Yumicko!

1073
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:11,819
Nuigulumar!

1074
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,532
I was finally able to transform as Yumicko!

1075
01:34:21,683 --> 01:34:25,665
Not judging moments of clumsyness, the healing and fighting teddy bear!

1076
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:29,016
The delightful hero, Nuigulumar arrives!

1077
01:34:29,267 --> 01:34:30,474
I will protect the Princess

1078
01:34:30,499 --> 01:34:32,186
I swear on these button eyes!
