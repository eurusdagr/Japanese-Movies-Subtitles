1
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:31,005
Aimi?!

2
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,424
It's OK, Dad. Hurry back.

3
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,718
They won't kill you now.

4
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:51,401
Dad! Hurry!

5
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,032
Here's one, dad.

6
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:42,619
For rent:
2BR apartment, 70,000/mo.

7
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,412
That one...

8
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:47,040
It doesn't look bad...

9
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:53,630
But it's a 35 year-old building,
a long way from the station...

10
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,511
Well, we have to compromise
on some things, don't we?

11
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,948
Mr. Yamato?

12
00:02:19,948 --> 00:02:21,115
Yes.

13
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:27,247
I've been expecting you,
I'm Ebisu, the Building Manager.

14
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,542
This way, please.

15
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:47,642
It's old, but it's been well maintained.

16
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:49,936
It's very comfortable.

17
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:56,025
I live with my wife
on the first floor.

18
00:02:56,025 --> 00:03:02,031
We've been here, how long?
Three years now...

19
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:17,630
Is the young lady in high school?

20
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:20,925
Yes. In Grade 11.

21
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,052
I see...

22
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,346
Excuse me.

23
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:34,147
Let's see... 301...

24
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:48,453
Come in.

25
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,958
The building's owner
lives out in the country.

26
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:58,046
It was built by a relative of his.

27
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:08,139
I understand he inherited it
when the first owner died.

28
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,433
Is it sound-proof?

29
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,063
I can't have thin walls.

30
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:19,567
I write at home,
so it can't be too noisy.

31
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,739
Write? You mean novels
or something?

32
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,034
No, I'm a freelance journalist.

33
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,955
I write about nice Italian restaurants'
or popular dating spots.

34
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,832
Dumb stuff like that.

35
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,251
I see...

36
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:43,049
Well, Aimi?

37
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,053
I like it...

38
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:50,473
Thank you very much!

39
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,561
I never thought
you'd decide so fast!

40
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:59,148
Oh, I'm so happy!

41
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:07,073
So you'll move in a week from now?
We'll be waiting.

42
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,950
Until then...

43
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,964
It's more than 35 years old...

44
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,142
Aimi!

45
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:45,570
Thus I first encountered
"the haunted apartments".

46
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:50,950
There I experienced fear...

47
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:55,747
...and more than that,
a grief that was deep and dark.

48
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,981
TALES OF TERROR
"The Haunted Apartments"

49
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:44,963
Show him in.

50
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,447
Mr. Yamato,
these are the residents.

51
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:15,159
How do you do.
I'm Hotei, from 103.

52
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:17,161
My wife, Masami.

53
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,955
How do you do.

54
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,166
Izumo, from 201, and my wife

55
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,587
We're right below you.
If you need anything, just ask.

56
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:30,091
I'm Kotobuki, from 203.
This is my boyfriend.

57
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,759
What?

58
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,888
How do you do.

59
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:47,275
Oh... I'm Yamato.
This is my daughter...

60
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,867
"Ai"

61
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:59,287
Is something wrong?

62
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,874
Aimi: Summer Clothes

63
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:08,963
Your name's Aimi?
What a pretty name!

64
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:11,883
It sure is! It suits her.

65
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:14,302
Well, everyone...

66
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:21,768
Let us help. It's the 3rd floor
and there's no elevator.

67
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,897
Many hands make light work!

68
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,982
Uh, thank you.

69
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:41,996
Wait, slow down a bit...

70
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,290
Are you OK? Shall I take it?

71
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,377
No, I'm fine. Sorry.

72
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,379
Where should we put this?

73
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,381
Uh, let me see...

74
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,300
In that corner for now.

75
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:07,981
You OK?

76
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,610
I've got it. You can let go.

77
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,074
301?

78
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,284
Yes.

79
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:23,288
I'm Takashi Izumo, from 201.
How do you do.

80
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:26,207
How do you do.

81
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,587
You're the first person my age here.

82
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:37,594
Isn't there a girl about my age?

83
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,891
With long hair, kind of pale...

84
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,184
There's no one like that.

85
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,786
Hello.

86
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,206
Hello.

87
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,588
They all seem nice.

88
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,299
Too damn nice.

89
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,221
That's why I hate apartments.

90
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:34,108
But it's my fault. I'm useless.

91
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,110
I'm sorry.

92
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,114
Don't apologize.

93
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,702
It'll be fine.

94
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:54,712
I just hate to think of the house
we lived in with mom...

95
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,716
...belonging to someone else.

96
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:09,102
This place is fine.

97
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:44,596
Mom...

98
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:52,520
...as of today, this is our home.

99
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,698
Mom...

100
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:10,997
...the truth is...

101
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,611
...I don't want to be here!

102
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,600
Aimi...

103
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,216
Aimi!

104
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,820
Coming.

105
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,701
What?

106
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,540
Here.

107
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,921
We're not unpacked yet.

108
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:02,623
That's OK.

109
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:15,937
Dad...

110
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:21,024
I've told you before...

111
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:27,907
...it's not your fault Mom died.

112
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:39,242
We're starting over now.

113
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,346
So...

114
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,510
...won't you quit drinking?

115
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,534
Dad?

116
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:02,524
Please...

117
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,927
Certificate of Commendation

118
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:17,828
Um, I've just moved into 301...

119
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:11,946
Come on you two!
Quick! Get in!

120
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,241
Come on!

121
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:21,956
In you get!

122
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:31,157
Um...

123
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,630
It's not our fault.

124
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:53,831
Be back by midnight.

125
00:16:56,032 --> 00:17:02,421
You have to be inside this rope
by 12 o'clock at night.

126
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,457
Why?

127
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,043
It's a regulation here.

128
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,337
Regulation?

129
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:12,966
Make absolutely sure
you don't break it.

130
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,763
Oh, and you'd better
tell your father, too.

131
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,736
Having to be back by midnight...
that's weird.

132
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:36,948
A curfew!

133
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,369
You'd think this was a school dorm!

134
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,831
Really!

135
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:35,965
Um...

136
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,345
...here.

137
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,766
The manager gave me your new address.
It's near my school.

138
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:47,852
Thank you.

139
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,737
What did you mean,
"It's not our fault"?

140
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,662
There's something weird
about that building.

141
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:12,043
It's got funny rules,
and those rocks out front...

142
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,341
And there's a girl my age there,
but they say there isn't.

143
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,143
You saw her?

144
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,341
That building is cursed.

145
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:34,065
I remember when
we first moved in there...

146
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,278
Coming!

147
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,675
It's the Manager.

148
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:45,785
Oh, yes...

149
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,074
Everything's all right?

150
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:56,186
Uh, yes, we're fine.

151
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:58,756
Make sure you observe the curfew.

152
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,577
And here's the building circular.

153
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,763
And your daughter's name...

154
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:10,984
...and the name of the daughter
of the building's first owner...

155
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,762
...are exactly the same!

156
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:17,090
So his daughter was named...

157
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:33,765
I suggest you don't say her name
when you're on this property.

158
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:43,874
I thought that was crazy,
so I didn't pay it any mind.

159
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,562
Papa! Dinner.

160
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:53,176
"A-chan"! Eat your carrots,
will you?

161
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,472
You too, "Takkun".
Chew your food.

162
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:00,676
Let's eat!

163
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,066
Papa! Leave the TV off
while we're eating.

164
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:08,867
It's OK.

165
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,786
No!

166
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,169
Let's do what Mama says.

167
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:23,373
This looks good!
Eat up those carrots.

168
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,298
What's wrong?

169
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:33,475
Hm?

170
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,770
Nothing, nothing.

171
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,768
Papa, wake up...

172
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,674
What's that noise?

173
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:18,704
Papa...

174
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,406
It's OK.

175
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,606
Takumi!

176
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:05,392
Takumi!

177
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,000
Takkun?

178
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,780
There's something strange
about this place!

179
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,299
Let's move!

180
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,786
We can't afford to.
We'd lose our deposit.

181
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:52,480
That's mine!

182
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,800
Both of you, be quiet!

183
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,304
Takumi!

184
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,106
Ai!

185
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,582
What are you doing?!

186
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,987
Papa, help!

187
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:24,122
Let go!

188
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,398
I can't!

189
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,291
What are you talking about!

190
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:28,625
Ai!

191
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:29,602
Let go!

192
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,905
Ai!

193
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,726
Papa, pull him off!

194
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,921
Takumi! Takumi!

195
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,020
Mariko!

196
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,930
There's no choice!

197
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,115
Don't be stupid!

198
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,733
He's killing Ai!

199
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,329
No, Mama!

200
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,497
Forgive me!

201
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,225
No! No!

202
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,718
Never say my name again.

203
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,215
Those are "the haunted apartments"

204
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:39,712
It's haunted by the daughter
of the man who had it built.

205
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:47,712
About 30 years ago,
when she was 17...

206
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:53,410
...she vanished on her way
home from school.

207
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:59,833
They say she loved her home
so much...

208
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:04,238
...she came back to it as a ghost.

209
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:09,218
That's who you saw.

210
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:20,345
She's very lonely,
so she calls other spirits.

211
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:30,030
And if a resident
doesn't get home by midnight...

212
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:34,626
...it's as if they'd betrayed her.

213
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,347
She kills them.

214
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,817
That's crazy!

215
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,352
No one believed it at first.

216
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:51,826
But the people
who didn't get back by 12...

217
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:54,855
...or the people who moved out...

218
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,052
...all died mysteriously,
right after midnight.

219
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,220
In 30 years, 13 families have died.

220
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:18,629
But you're alive, and a day's passed
since you moved out.

221
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,333
There's one rule that saves us.

222
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,144
A "rule"?

223
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:31,050
When someone new moves in,
the oldest tenants can leave.

224
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,037
The residents figured that out
over the years.

225
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:42,544
We'd been there the longest,
and then you moved in.

226
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:55,832
We've been set free.

227
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:05,359
At last I can say my girl's name.

228
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:31,542
They're 12 years old.
They're in middle school.

229
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:12,534
Hello.

230
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,253
Hello.

231
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,139
Aren't you going in?

232
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,261
Um...

233
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:33,337
...have you ever violated curfew?
Come home after midnight?

234
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,153
Nobody who lives here
ever does that.

235
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:44,449
That's why we're alive.

236
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,437
We get to leave next.

237
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,870
I'm scared.

238
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:02,641
I don't want to go in there.

239
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:10,275
Why is all this happening to me?!

240
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:19,466
Two years ago, my mother died
in a car accident.

241
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:26,274
Then my dad fell apart.

242
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,573
And now...

243
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:43,157
I'm sick of all this!

244
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:56,162
It's OK, it won't all be bad forever.

245
00:30:56,846 --> 00:31:00,066
One day you'll get out of here.

246
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:07,048
And if anything scares you,
just yell out the window.

247
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:10,852
I'm right below you.
I'll come running.

248
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,776
Come on.

249
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,947
This is stupid!

250
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,677
"Haunted apartments"!

251
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,861
You don't believe it?

252
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:59,384
Supernatural phenomena
are just products of the mind.

253
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:06,458
A moving curtain looks like someone.
You think your own shadow's a ghost.

254
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,454
Enough nonsense. Time for bed.

255
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,554
Yuichi, Noriko and Takashi Izumo

256
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,689
Notice of transfer: Osaka

257
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,594
I asked the Department Head
to wait till tomorrow for an answer.

258
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:14,185
But I doubt we'll have anyone new
moving in right away.

259
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,890
Should I refuse the transfer?

260
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:18,992
Wait a minute!

261
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,880
What if we end up
like Mr. and Mrs. Hotei in 103?

262
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,075
I couldn't live like that!

263
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:32,862
And how would we put Takashi
through university?

264
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:34,597
That's OK.

265
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:36,466
No, it's not!

266
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:44,573
I'm fed up with having my life run
by this apartment building!

267
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:48,187
Here.

268
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:50,598
Thanks.

269
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,695
You get home from school real late.

270
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:01,076
Is your dad OK there alone?

271
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:08,174
My dad doesn't believe in ghosts.

272
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,709
You saw Mrs. Hotei, from 103...

273
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,573
They have money problems.

274
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:31,281
Mr. Hotei used to work at
a blue-chip company.

275
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:37,378
He refused a transfer because of
this building, and got in trouble.

276
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,881
He had to quit.

277
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:45,587
New jobs are hard to find these days.

278
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,896
My parents don't want that.

279
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,617
We're going to Osaka.

280
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:03,713
Osaka?

281
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,408
Dad's accepting a transfer.

282
00:37:09,002 --> 00:37:10,612
But if you do that...

283
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:12,322
We won't know till we try.

284
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,411
We'll survive. I know we will.

285
00:37:19,712 --> 00:37:23,124
We might even lift the curse.

286
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,111
Then you'll be free.

287
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,092
So if we do manage to stay alive...

288
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,103
...can I see you again?

289
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,820
Will you think about it?

290
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,014
They're crazy!

291
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,517
Yeah! They're next in line...

292
00:38:08,227 --> 00:38:12,931
They're even willing
to sacrifice their son!

293
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:17,003
Takashi! This is the last.

294
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,010
It's all yours.

295
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:34,595
Um...

296
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:41,601
...here.

297
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,206
My mother made it.

298
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:50,236
I've kept it as a good-luck charm.

299
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:52,930
I can't take that!

300
00:38:56,926 --> 00:39:02,207
I want to see you again.

301
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,109
Thank you.

302
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,511
Well...

303
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:54,624
I'd better go buy some things
for dinner.

304
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,432
Aw, Mom! What are you doing?

305
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:10,942
We'll be OK, won't we? That curse
can't reach all the way to Osaka...

306
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,135
...Can it?

307
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,926
Let's go out somewhere
where there's lots of people.

308
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:27,034
We'll be fine.
As long as we're here, we're fine.

309
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:42,634
We have to get out of here!

310
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:55,430
Dad? Mom?

311
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:14,550
Mom?

312
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:33,134
Takashi! Help!

313
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:33,935
Dad?!

314
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,015
Takashi!

315
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:39,816
Dad?

316
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:45,330
Dad!

317
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:49,634
Takashi! Help me!

318
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,254
You can kill me!

319
00:45:06,255 --> 00:45:08,749
But let her go!

320
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,544
Just let her out of that building!

321
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,555
Please!

322
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,922
I'm saved!

323
00:46:21,162 --> 00:46:25,032
Takashi, are you all right?

324
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,661
She disappeared.

325
00:46:29,062 --> 00:46:30,855
Really?

326
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:36,453
I'm all right. I'm safe.

327
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:39,330
Thanks to you.

328
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,468
Takashi...

329
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:50,657
Where's the charm I gave you?

330
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,069
Sir?

331
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:29,856
Madam?

332
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:17,654
...after discussion
with his lawyers.

333
00:48:17,837 --> 00:48:20,667
In other news, a family of three
have died mysteriously...

334
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,236
...in an all-night restaurant.

335
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:28,675
Just after midnight this morning,
in "F" restaurant in Osaka...

336
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:32,762
...Yuichi Izumo, his wife Noriko
and son Takashi...

337
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:38,158
...were found dead at their table,
their hands linked.

338
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:41,354
Mr. and Mrs. Izumo had been stabbed,
and their son strangled...

339
00:48:41,354 --> 00:48:44,765
...but no weapon was found.

340
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:48,653
No witnesses have emerged,
although the restaurant was busy.

341
00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:52,866
All three were apparently
in good health...

342
00:48:53,074 --> 00:48:57,453
...before a brief power failure
ay exactly 12 midnight.

343
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:01,856
Aimi!

344
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:04,176
I'm coming in.

345
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:10,248
What happened?

346
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:28,048
"Haunted apartments"...

347
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:40,572
Did they die?

348
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:44,467
Yes. All three of them.

349
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,670
How?

350
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:54,886
The husband and wife were stabbed.
Young Takashi was strangled.

351
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,564
The poor thing!

352
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:05,887
You suffer the most being strangled.

353
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:11,186
Could I have some water?

354
00:51:19,694 --> 00:51:21,487
Sorry to be so much trouble.

355
00:51:21,488 --> 00:51:24,073
I'm the one to say that.

356
00:51:29,988 --> 00:51:31,698
But Shizu...

357
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:36,995
...finally we're the ones
who get to leave next.

358
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,173
Yes...

359
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:49,090
But I wonder how many nights
there'll be until that happens...

360
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,581
Whose turn is it?

361
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:32,492
Mine.

362
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:34,102
How?

363
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:37,788
I was taken by the enemy...

364
00:52:39,182 --> 00:52:41,284
...and strangled.

365
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:48,967
Proceed. Give vent to your rage.

366
00:52:58,685 --> 00:53:01,403
Couldn't it be me tonight?

367
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:07,001
Kill me if you have to kill anyone.
My wife has done nothing!

368
00:53:07,294 --> 00:53:09,971
That's why we kill her.

369
00:53:10,496 --> 00:53:11,607
Lieutenant...

370
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:17,112
...vengeance is best taken on
the one its object loves best.

371
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:20,899
Please! Stop killing my wife!

372
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,584
Please!

373
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,498
Once we begged you.

374
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:33,795
"Don't leave us," we said.
"We want to go back to Japan!"

375
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,500
But to save yourself...

376
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:41,603
...you abandoned us.
You left us there.

377
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,505
I was wrong!

378
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:49,410
At least don't strangle her!

379
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,187
Please!

380
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:54,298
I see... all right...

381
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:58,294
We'll strangle her every night.

382
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,617
Umihiko...

383
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,794
Forgive me!

384
00:55:30,086 --> 00:55:33,807
Would it be better
if I just killed you myself?

385
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:39,294
You promised me, remember?

386
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:44,517
You said once we got out of here...

387
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:49,605
...We'd go back up home
to Miyazaki.

388
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:55,303
Let's pray...

389
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:58,807
...that real, real soon...

390
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:03,412
...a new tenant will move in here.

391
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:17,991
But the night will come again,
won't it?

392
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:23,306
Kotobuki

393
00:56:25,908 --> 00:56:27,418
'Morning, Sho.

394
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:33,299
The Izumis died. I knew they would.

395
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,403
They did?

396
00:56:37,412 --> 00:56:39,422
It was on TV.

397
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,436
What's your problem?

398
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,022
This is your fault!

399
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:51,034
You're the one
who brought me here!

400
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:54,737
You wrecked my whole life!

401
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:05,323
If this place wasn't cursed,
would you move out?

402
00:57:05,324 --> 00:57:07,325
What are you talking about?

403
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:12,013
Would I still be with an old cow
like you if it wasn't?!

404
00:57:35,728 --> 00:57:36,705
Money.

405
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:39,424
For Pachinko.

406
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:47,215
What's that?

407
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,909
That's not enough.

408
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:52,237
I've only got 1,000 more.

409
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,516
You're broke too!

410
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,314
You're awful!

411
00:58:03,715 --> 00:58:04,933
Anyway, Akemi...

412
00:58:05,016 --> 00:58:06,234
What?

413
00:58:06,235 --> 00:58:08,428
Come out with me for once!

414
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:13,241
Sorry, I've got a cat.
I have to catch the last bus.

415
00:58:13,242 --> 00:58:15,335
It won't starve in one night!

416
00:58:15,336 --> 00:58:17,545
It'll die of loneliness.

417
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:18,947
So will I!

418
00:58:18,948 --> 00:58:20,723
Silly!

419
00:58:20,724 --> 00:58:22,858
Take care. See you again!

420
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,351
Thanks!

421
00:58:24,352 --> 00:58:25,827
Thank you!

422
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:29,766
What's with her?

423
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:32,427
Don't worry. She's always like that.

424
00:58:32,428 --> 00:58:33,228
Good night!

425
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:35,229
Good night!

426
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:49,835
Hey, you!

427
00:58:49,836 --> 00:58:52,255
Sorry! It's an emergency!

428
00:58:52,256 --> 00:58:53,649
Tanashi, and hurry!

429
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:10,948
What's going on?!

430
00:59:11,457 --> 00:59:13,050
An accident maybe...

431
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:16,645
Who'd have an accident
at this time of night!

432
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:17,872
I'll get out.

433
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:22,143
That's 1,290.

434
00:59:23,753 --> 00:59:25,963
Oh, damn that Sho!

435
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:28,166
I'm sorry, this is all I have.

436
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:31,477
I can't do that, ma'am...

437
00:59:31,478 --> 00:59:32,971
OK, here. Take these.

438
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:35,239
Look, lady...

439
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:37,950
Oh, come on! It's only 190!

440
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:40,578
Hey! Officer! Over here! Officer!

441
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:48,061
Hey, you! Stop!

442
00:59:48,145 --> 00:59:49,263
Hey!

443
00:59:49,463 --> 00:59:50,148
Hold it!

444
00:59:50,148 --> 00:59:51,482
Hey!

445
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:53,776
Stop!

446
00:59:53,985 --> 00:59:56,954
Hold it, you!

447
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,779
Where'd she go?

448
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:23,354
What's wrong?

449
01:00:23,354 --> 01:00:25,089
We're a bit worried.

450
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:27,692
Akemi's not back yet.

451
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,653
She's usually here by now.

452
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,956
We hear her come in.

453
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:35,475
What do you want?!

454
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:37,093
Where's Akemi?

455
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,564
How would I know?

456
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:58,672
She's not answering her phone.

457
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:07,890
Where am I?!

458
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:11,369
Sho! Help me!

459
01:01:11,994 --> 01:01:14,780
Help me!

460
01:01:15,565 --> 01:01:16,783
Akemi!

461
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:17,867
Sho!

462
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,687
Akemi! Akemi!

463
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:21,604
Sho!

464
01:01:21,604 --> 01:01:23,006
What are you doing?!

465
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:25,884
Get on, quick!

466
01:01:25,885 --> 01:01:29,595
Here goes! How long have we got?

467
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:31,890
Less than four minutes!

468
01:01:43,393 --> 01:01:44,302
Sho...

469
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,996
...I could die happy right now.

470
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:50,400
What are you talking about?!
Hang on, will you!

471
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:05,289
Everyone, get inside the line.

472
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:08,101
Hurry! Get inside!

473
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:13,302
There!

474
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,209
Quick! You've got to hurry!

475
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:17,212
Faster!

476
01:02:17,212 --> 01:02:18,796
Hurry!

477
01:02:18,796 --> 01:02:20,882
Come on!

478
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:24,719
Come on! You can do it!

479
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:25,512
Come on!

480
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:27,805
Yes! Come on!

481
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:34,719
Five seconds...

482
01:02:53,296 --> 01:02:55,314
Sho?

483
01:02:55,323 --> 01:02:58,709
Sho! Sho!

484
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:04,992
Isn't it great Akemi made it!

485
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:06,710
Yeah!

486
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,689
And now we have no food at all!

487
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:14,502
The water's been shut off.

488
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:14,795
What?!

489
01:04:14,796 --> 01:04:15,997
It has?

490
01:04:18,915 --> 01:04:21,517
You shouldn't have married me.

491
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,594
I don't mind.

492
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:28,195
So what about dinner?

493
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:51,105
Bon appétit!

494
01:04:58,596 --> 01:05:01,198
It's good!

495
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:04,735
It sure is!

496
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:19,800
You're working hard.

497
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,803
Hello. Are you going out?

498
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:25,005
Could I talk to you?

499
01:05:25,014 --> 01:05:26,023
About what?

500
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:29,719
I drink myself to sleep
every night...

501
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:32,721
...so I don't see "things".

502
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:40,830
My daughter's terrified.

503
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:44,541
What are they like?

504
01:06:02,034 --> 01:06:04,721
School Study Excursion

505
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:08,031
"Osaka"...

506
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,741
I'd like to go...

507
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,645
...and visit his grave.

508
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:55,421
"Ai Takamatsu, 17, in Grade 11,
has been reported missing".

509
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:59,634
"Her father Shigeaki says
that on the night of the 6th...

510
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:03,712
...she did not return to school".

511
01:07:03,713 --> 01:07:10,234
"'I'm sure something happened
on her way home.' he said."

512
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,849
On her way home...

513
01:07:19,554 --> 01:07:23,249
Just getting home, Ai?

514
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:30,514
It must be nice
to always look so young!

515
01:07:30,748 --> 01:07:35,436
Look! My cat's gone and died again!

516
01:07:42,051 --> 01:07:45,429
Um... "Ai"?

517
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,849
Oh, you're not her...

518
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:53,120
Did Ai live in that building?

519
01:07:56,056 --> 01:08:00,927
A beautiful young girl, she was.
Just like you.

520
01:08:01,253 --> 01:08:05,549
She went missing, didn't she?
Coming home from school.

521
01:08:05,558 --> 01:08:07,551
That's a lie.

522
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,153
I saw her!

523
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:13,240
She came home that day.

524
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:33,553
No one believed me, but I saw her!

525
01:08:37,356 --> 01:08:40,158
She came home?

526
01:09:23,044 --> 01:09:25,062
What do you want?!

527
01:09:25,063 --> 01:09:29,050
Mr. Yamato, I certainly hope
you're not betraying us.

528
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:30,242
Betraying you?

529
01:09:30,243 --> 01:09:34,255
You're writing an article
about this building, aren't you!

530
01:09:34,256 --> 01:09:38,067
You were an ace reporter
for a weekly scandal magazine...

531
01:09:42,938 --> 01:09:45,257
Shouldn't I?

532
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:51,439
People are dying here!
Of course I'm writing about it.

533
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:57,645
Oh, I get it...

534
01:09:57,646 --> 01:10:01,148
You want some of the money,
do you?

535
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:04,368
If I make anything, I'll share it.

536
01:10:04,369 --> 01:10:05,452
OK?

537
01:10:05,453 --> 01:10:07,062
It's not the damn money!

538
01:10:08,272 --> 01:10:12,568
If people find out about this place,
no one'll move in.

539
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:15,279
We'll never get out.

540
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:18,473
We're all linked by fate.

541
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:22,077
No one acts on his own!

542
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:27,758
Go away.

543
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:29,977
Go away!

544
01:10:30,878 --> 01:10:32,279
Leave!

545
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:34,073
Get out of here!

546
01:10:34,073 --> 01:10:35,967
Aimi, get inside.

547
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,285
Go!

548
01:10:46,268 --> 01:10:47,770
What happened?

549
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,857
"Don't write," they say.

550
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:07,364
Dad...

551
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:16,089
Ghost stories always draw people.
This place'll be famous.

552
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:21,778
This might be my last chance.

553
01:12:58,668 --> 01:13:00,861
I'll leave this here.

554
01:13:23,259 --> 01:13:26,278
She comes here...

555
01:13:30,475 --> 01:13:32,185
It's Yamato.

556
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,888
Did you read the article I sent?

557
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:40,560
You didn't get it?

558
01:13:41,177 --> 01:13:43,387
Really?

559
01:13:44,197 --> 01:13:46,266
Just a second...

560
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:50,203
Task Error

561
01:13:50,203 --> 01:13:52,396
What the hell?!

562
01:13:52,588 --> 01:13:54,098
Sorry...

563
01:13:55,683 --> 01:13:58,077
I'll bring it right over.

564
01:14:15,186 --> 01:14:17,479
You old bastard!

565
01:14:17,705 --> 01:14:19,173
You're not leaving.

566
01:14:20,908 --> 01:14:24,186
You're not going anywhere.

567
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:27,798
What the hell?!

568
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,106
Kill him!

569
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:38,283
Kill him!

570
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:10,799
Back away!

571
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:21,209
Dad?

572
01:15:22,278 --> 01:15:24,088
Are you OK?

573
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:32,289
They've gone crazy!

574
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:35,101
Are we going to get killed?

575
01:16:43,209 --> 01:16:45,794
Aimi! Get stuff that burns!

576
01:17:14,724 --> 01:17:16,600
I'm letting go!

577
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:20,713
Quick, dad!

578
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:31,523
Here goes...

579
01:17:37,621 --> 01:17:41,016
Aimi? Are you OK?

580
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:47,707
It's nearly 12.

581
01:17:48,599 --> 01:17:51,327
They can't come out here.

582
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,689
You get away.

583
01:17:53,715 --> 01:18:00,720
I can find the source of the
curse by midnight.

584
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,807
That'll stop them.

585
01:18:08,594 --> 01:18:10,204
Get going!

586
01:18:12,106 --> 01:18:13,224
Quick!

587
01:20:29,432 --> 01:20:31,700
Let go.

588
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:39,525
I...

589
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:43,022
...want to be free.

590
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,730
Please!

591
01:23:42,802 --> 01:23:45,329
Ai...

592
01:23:46,506 --> 01:23:50,001
It must have been agony...

593
01:23:50,002 --> 01:23:54,238
...being closed in there.

594
01:23:55,717 --> 01:23:59,211
And so lonely...

595
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:13,920
Aimi!

596
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,431
It's OK, dad. Hurry back.

597
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:18,642
They won't kill you now.

598
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,208
Dad!

599
01:24:42,226 --> 01:24:44,428
Hurry, Dad!

600
01:24:52,513 --> 01:24:53,431
Dad!

601
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:55,525
Aimi!

602
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:08,946
Dad...

603
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:16,321
It's your fault
they went crazy like like that.

604
01:25:18,249 --> 01:25:24,130
You shouldn't do things
that people really don't want you to.

605
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:31,030
I was wrong.

606
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,215
I'm sorry.

607
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:39,046
The real line...

608
01:25:40,215 --> 01:25:42,933
...is here.

609
01:26:28,943 --> 01:26:31,520
Serves you right.

610
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:13,751
Dad, no!

611
01:28:18,153 --> 01:28:20,648
The same thing...

612
01:28:24,854 --> 01:28:28,256
...happened to you.

613
01:28:41,339 --> 01:28:43,124
I'm back.

614
01:28:49,756 --> 01:28:52,026
Ai, you're home!

615
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,445
Come here...

616
01:28:56,556 --> 01:28:58,950
Stop it, Dad!

617
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,837
No!

618
01:29:06,249 --> 01:29:07,543
Ow!

619
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,129
You bitch!

620
01:29:53,959 --> 01:29:56,361
Everyone's gone.

621
01:30:01,658 --> 01:30:04,243
But...

622
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:07,955
...I'm not going anywhere.

623
01:30:13,361 --> 01:30:16,572
I'll be with you...

624
01:30:20,134 --> 01:30:24,761
...forever.

625
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:30,673
Aimi
Mei Kurokawa

626
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:11,756
Aimi's Father
Mitsuru Fukikoshi
