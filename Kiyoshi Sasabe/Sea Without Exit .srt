1
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:45,902
- Sea Without Exit -

2
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:55,890
"Alert! Quickly StandBy!"

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,991
"Alert!"

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,467
Hurry Up! Hurry Up!

5
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:02,662
Alert!

6
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:04,070
Hurry Up!

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,159
Are you okay?

8
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,100
Yes.

9
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:12,236
"To Your Positions!"

10
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:13,904
Are you okay?

11
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,999
Yes.

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,751
Ito, pull yourself up!

13
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:26,822
Yes.

14
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:30,854
Alert!

15
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,389
Are we going to be okay?

16
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:34,861
Do not worry!

17
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:37,226
Commander.

18
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,529
Sub-Lieutenant Namiki, pull yourself up!

19
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,663
Alert!

20
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:58,076
80m under the surface,
Goto Depthcharge Defense!

21
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:05,183
Don't move! Stay calm!

22
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,261
There's no problem.

23
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:15,964
Hard To Port! Full Speed Ahead!

24
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,800
Hard To Port!

25
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,103
Full Speed Ahead!

26
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:25,936
Are we being found?

27
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,278
Damn it! Not here!

28
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,646
Calm down!

29
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:07,714
(external water sounds are heard on headphones)

30
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,023
It seems they ran out of depth charges.

31
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,699
Where is the enemy direction now?

32
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,598
They are just above us.

33
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,733
above...

34
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:28,701
On the aft left side 30°
two enemy ships.

35
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:33,312
After they mark our submarine,
they will call another ship over.

36
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:36,311
Ah! this will be a long fight.

37
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:40,956
Stop Engines. Run Silent.

38
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,023
Stop Engines. Run Silent.

39
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,410
We've been discovered.
Are you guys okay?

40
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,311
Yes.

41
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:06,611
Turn it down, or they will hear you.

42
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,286
We can only wait here quietly.

43
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,089
Radiators and fans can not be used,
so we will become hot.

44
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,187
available oxygen will reduce,

45
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,300
and it will be for quite some time.

46
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:21,796
If you feel unwell contact a medic - okay?

47
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:23,159
Yes...

48
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:31,764
Ito coming.

49
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:37,778
Sub-Lieutenant Namiki, you dropped this.

50
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:39,278
Thanks.

51
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,844
Officer Ito, are the Kaiten' all right?

52
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,547
I worry about them too.

53
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,455
I really want to go out and check them.

54
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:49,546
Yes.

55
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,787
This will be for a long time, you know.

56
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,953
Let's just lie down.

57
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:08,878
(Kaiten were manned torpedo suicide craft,
used by the Imperial Japanese Navy...)

58
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:11,103
(... during the final stages of the war).

59
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,333
Okita!

60
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:33,927
How's the temperature now?

61
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,774
40°C

62
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:45,006
Just like sleeping in a steam bath.

63
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,922
<thinking back>
"Namiki, throw a strike out!"

64
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:56,955
"Go, Namiki !"

65
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,822
Meiji University team vs
Waseda University team

66
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,033
What do you think you're doing!

67
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,709
I thought it would be a strike.

68
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,939
Why not pitch a straight ball ?
Why change strategy ?

69
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:19,707
Stop it.

70
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:21,305
Don't argue here!

71
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,883
You guys did OK -  well done!

72
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,748
The Opponents Win!

73
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,258
You know my shoulder is unable to throw
that simple straight ball needed to win.

74
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,890
Don't make excuses!

75
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:05,384
When I pitch a straight ball like this,
there is no need to use a strong wrist,

76
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:09,125
after a second the ball will curve.

77
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,892
Yet in the end it still failed.

78
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,425
It is easy to hit,
because it does not have speed.

79
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:16,805
But pitch the ball away from the catcher,
like today's game, it can be easily missed.

80
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,599
That's why I want the batter to think
I'm gonna pitch a straight ball.

81
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,872
Throw the ball to his chest
and suddenly it's a strike.

82
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:23,374
Do you mean like drop your aim ?

83
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,038
Well no.

84
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:26,071
Iit's like this, bend over
the middle finger.

85
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,844
The index finger and ring
finger on each other side.

86
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,985
See the batter directly, then pitch
a fast ball that will keep rotating;

87
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:34,119
but on the last second it
drops towards the catcher.

88
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:37,149
If you do it right,
the ball will disappear in a blink.

89
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,127
As theory - it really works ?

90
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:42,949
Sawamura Eiji <a famous prof. pitcher>
could pitch a sinking curve ball.

91
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:45,557
The ball seems to fly on three sections.
Go... go... go...

92
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:46,760
Nonsense!

93
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,804
Sawamura is a pitcher that
even Babe Ruth couldn't hit...

94
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,241
... are you at the same level as him?

95
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,139
Are you still upset?

96
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:57,474
If he follows my instructions,
we can win the game.

97
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,510
Here we go again.

98
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,505
with Namiki holding
a pain injury on his shoulder;

99
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:01,981
you should consider that too.

100
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,348
Rather than doing baseball...

101
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:09,517
Isn't it better to practice
throwing grenades ?

102
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:12,486
You are Kita the athletics runner, right ?

103
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,823
I've already quit on athletics.

104
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,693
Were your feet injured  too ?

105
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,200
It gets boring.

106
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,859
What do you want to say?

107
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,030
Just because you quit athletics,
you want us to give up baseball too?

108
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,542
For six baseball universities,
Autumn Games are called off, right?

109
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,311
That's because there's movement
from hostile countries.

110
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:35,347
So how about your marathon tournament?
the London Olympic was canceled, right?

111
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:38,776
You're blaming that to quit athletics?

112
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,889
Olympics...

113
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,695
Simply no longer matters to me.

114
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,095
I gave up running because...

115
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,156
There's no way to run.

116
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm dehydrated !
I can't stand this anymore!

117
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,641
How long has this been ?

118
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,874
Three and half hours.

119
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,711
Why has the enemy not given up yet ?

120
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:49,782
Chihara!
Give me water!

121
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:50,917
Yes.

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,987
We've found them.

123
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:56,865
On the aft left side 20°
there are three ships.

124
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,225
No, there's four.

125
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,596
They are coming.

126
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:06,038
Full Speed, 10° right side,
there's another enemy ship in action.

127
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,937
Depth charges dropped!!!

128
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:09,305
Depthcharge - Defense!

129
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,491
Depthcharge - Defense!

130
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,815
Damn it! Are we gonna die here
even before we launch "Kaiten" ?

131
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,168
Hey, quick!
fix this!

132
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,100
Chihara, bring out more towels!

133
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,265
Yess.

134
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:44,545
Can't we go deeper - to 100 meters ?

135
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:46,041
No - not possible.

136
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,846
The "Kaiten" safety depth limit is 80m.

137
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,181
We can't dive deeper than this depth.

138
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:01,558
Until the last moment, keep on course.

139
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:04,292
Yes.

140
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:05,991
I don't want to die here.

141
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,935
Let's ask the captain to launch us out.

142
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:10,428
There's no other way.
Let's use the "Kaiten" to kill the enemy.

143
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,830
Wait, no matter how you think,
that's a rush decision.

144
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,272
With the submarine moving,

145
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,642
How will they launch "Kaiten" ?

146
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,703
So, it's okay for you to die here?

147
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:20,179
I definitely don't want it.

148
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,084
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:27,719
But could you all please be quite.

150
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,188
What's happening ?

151
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:31,285
The submarine is rising.

152
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:32,587
What?

153
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,428
How we gonna fight while moving up?

154
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:40,563
Listen!

155
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,533
The submarine is coming
up to a depth of 40 m.

156
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,767
Will we be okay doing that?

157
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:49,902
Enemy depth charge explosions
are at 80 meters

158
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:52,378
As long as we keep track on the explosions,

159
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,742
we could avoid them by rising until
they explode below us.

160
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,377
Then we'll find a way to escape.

161
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:58,510
So we have to receive it either way?

162
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:03,014
Our Captain -
is god of the submarine service.

163
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:07,029
He is from Sanuki Province, so
he has "Konpira-sama" with him.

164
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,989
It will be fine. Leave it to us.

165
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:13,414
<Sanuki is home to "Konpira-sama">
    <the god of ships and voyages>

166
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:14,902
Slow speed ahead!

167
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:29,248
Present depth 65 meters.

168
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:35,947
Depth 55 meters.

169
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,559
At this level, keep floating up.

170
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:56,275
The sound of that explosion
came from below.

171
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,676
Are we safe now?

172
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:04,610
On the aft right side 20°
there are three enemy ships.

173
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:10,522
In addition, two more
on the aft left side 30°.

174
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,726
gradually moving away.

175
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,761
They gonna keep chasing us or not...

176
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:19,229
Now we can only rely on "Konpira-sama".

177
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,491
Are you okay?

178
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,903
Uh huh -
Just went to empty my bladder.

179
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:33,081
<thinking back to October 21, 1943>

180
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:36,219
<Send-off ceremony for 25,000>
<drafted students at the Meiji School>

181
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:39,507
<Gaien National Olympic Stadium,>
<before going to war in World War II>

182
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:42,847
"Young Japanese Empire students -"

183
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:48,120
"leave the school enthusiastic,
and embark on the journey."

184
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,192
"Rush ahead full-force to the enemy".

185
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,993
"Years of hard and rigorous
learning and training,"

186
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:59,556
"will be dedicated to a glorious mission",

187
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:02,398
"to come forward...
... and wipe out our enemies."

188
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:10,040
"Long live the Emperor..."
"... Long live !    Long live !"

189
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:21,780
Hey.

190
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,188
Welcome.

191
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,987
Sir, are there empty seats?

192
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:29,120
Ah, just come in and try to find one.

193
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,031
Give us four cups of coffee.

194
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,097
Okay.

195
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:36,499
We're about to leave.

196
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:38,937
Hey, your clothes not wet?

197
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,202
You didn't come to the ceremony?

198
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:42,942
I already signed up to join the army.

199
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,142
So there's no need to
go to the Jingu Gaien Stadium.

200
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,778
What service did you enroll?

201
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,282
Navy.

202
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:52,581
Rather than being forcibly ordered,
I choose to volunteer on my own.

203
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,490
Today I just had to taste this
bad coffee before I go.

204
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,024
Give a good fight.

205
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:03,760
When we win the war,
you can participate in the Olympics again.

206
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:11,572
There's no way I'm coming home alive.

207
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:22,080
Maybe I should be a soldier too.

208
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:25,448
Becoming a soldier is not the only way
to make a contribution to the country.

209
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:27,647
We as college students
have our own mission.

210
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:30,486
Because of this, up to now we
have not been given a chance.

211
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:35,162
It seems I made a mistake going to college.

212
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:38,289
I simply can't stay still
and just read at school.

213
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,062
But I can't become a formal soldier.

214
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,899
Not just me, you too Gouhara,
Tabakura, also Namiki.

215
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:45,938
Listen, Obata.

216
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:51,442
Last month when I return home,
I went to visit my junior high school,

217
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:53,209
I met former teachers there.

218
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,931
Later I found the
4th & 5th grade classrooms empty.

219
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:03,624
On each table of empty seats
there's a tag called "expedite".

220
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,353
They have become
Naval Flight Preparatory trainees.

221
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,590
They are just junior high students.

222
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:15,132
There's a lot of students younger than us
already prepared to face battle.

223
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:18,896
If my right-man catcher is gone,

224
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,328
how can I create my magic ball.

225
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,839
Magic ball?

226
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:25,071
You still hold on to that hope ?
227
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:26,914
There are no more games.

228
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:28,679
You're not answering my question.

229
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:32,280
Are you going to walk out as my partner
even before the ball is complete?

230
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,374
The kind of ball you can't pitch?

231
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:35,977
We will never know if we don't try.

232
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,547
Just give up!

233
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,960
There's no such thing as a magic ball.

234
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:43,302
If you have so much energy thinking it,
then best use that for the country.

235
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:45,696
Now Japan is at war with the US!

236
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,670
I will join the army.

237
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,906
Even if I have to die,
I will die as a brave man.

238
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,269
You...

239
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:57,768
just because of a few simple sweet words
you are ready to give up baseball?

240
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,437
Baseball is just a childish game.

241
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:00,981
Childish game?

242
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:04,042
Are you seriously saying that?

243
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:08,114
Then how about the war?

244
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:12,626
Just try to take away each other lands.
Is that so great?!

245
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,595
Are you too, seriously saying that?

246
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,058
Stop it!

247
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,634
You guys don't know who might hear this.

248
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,232
I need to think by myself.

249
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:37,413
Sir, you too will get into
trouble for playing "Bolero".

250
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:38,966
<background music 'Bolero' composed by Ravel>

251
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:39,987
France is also our enemy.

252
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,478
If the military found it wrong,

253
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,890
I will tell them that Ravel was German.

254
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,665
[Nakano, Tokyo]

255
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,746
boy:  "Sachiko"
girl replies:   "Welcome Home!"

256
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,031
I'm back.

257
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:03,841
I'm back.

258
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,503
Brother!

259
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,249
Hey, you should reply "welcome back".

260
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,230
We have a guest.

261
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,797
Wah, you're very be-coming.

262
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,433
Minako-san just came from
Jingu Gaien Stadium, too.

263
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,738
What? When it was raining?

264
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:41,109
I was searching for you Koji-san,
but didn't see you.

265
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,810
So I thought I'd come here to say hi.

266
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:46,010
Your clothes must have gotten wet.

267
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,348
We asked her to change.

268
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:52,022
Minako-san, the dress she's wearing
is pretty, right?

269
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:54,521
It was mom's dress when she was young.

270
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:59,826
It's been a long time since wearing skirts,
I feel little uncomfortable.

271
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:02,967
Welcome back.

272
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:05,733
You must be all wet!

273
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:09,833
Hurry up change the clothes,
or you will get cold.

274
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,003
Thank you, Mom.

275
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:13,546
Minako-san, we will eat dinner soon.

276
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:14,808
Yes.

277
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:17,217
Sachi, help me.

278
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,245
Yes.

279
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:34,935
Those taro...

280
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:38,803
... father's students planted at school.

281
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:42,070
Well, although small, they taste good.

282
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,574
There are so many kinds of taro.

283
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,079
The one given by the government
are not sweet at all.

284
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:48,945
They only appear big in size;

285
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,608
but nothing inside.

286
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,782
Are you talking about me?

287
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:55,586
No one said that.

288
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,855
Koji, there's more if you want.

289
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:02,663
No, I'm full.

290
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,632
You do not look happy.

291
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,893
Are you cold?

292
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:18,267
Father.

293
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,972
What happened?

294
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:28,647
I'm going to volunteer.

295
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,089
Say it one more time.

296
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:36,623
I want to join the Navy.

297
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,333
There is no other choice.

298
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,665
I think I should go.

299
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:47,564
But, you haven't received notice yet.

300
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,538
This thing - there is no need to hurry.

301
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:53,773
The result is still the same,
it will come eventually.

302
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,873
The college will send the notice.

303
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:59,246
Father, is this okay?

304
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:05,524
Think about it wisely.

305
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,286
Then your own goodness will decide.

306
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:21,373
Tea...

307
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,304
Could you pour another one?

308
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,710
Navy surely fits you, Koji-san.

309
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,084
Especially those white naval uniforms.

310
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:38,083
Actually whether Army or Navy
it is fine for me;

311
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:44,330
but I have a  feeling that our Navy
treat their comrades better.

312
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:54,463
However, you're immediately
going to the front-line, right?

313
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,940
Well first, Marine regiment training
will take 4 months,

314
00:22:58,046 --> 00:23:00,290
to learn the basics as a soldier.

315
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,030
Then I  become a Navy Reserve student,
if you pass the test.

316
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:06,020
I can enter a specialized
technical school.

317
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,677
Navy reserve student?

318
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,190
Students who pass the test,
have prospects to become an officer.

319
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:15,490
"Reserve" - means I become a spare one.

320
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:20,497
So, after you graduate from school,
then the front-line?

321
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:25,364
Because Japan has started losing the war,
they do need more troops.

322
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,998
Japan is losing?

323
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:33,576
No, but it's impossible
to win every battle.

324
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,426
Koji-san.

325
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,490
What?

326
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,634
Could you give me this photo?

327
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,808
What are you going to do with it?

328
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:12,744
I will put this photo on
my desk and sing to it,

329
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:15,587
for encouraging you, Koji-san.

330
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,056
What song?

331
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,566
<Title: Aa Kurenai no Chi wa Moyuru>
<Composer:Akemoto Kyousei>

339
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:11,704
Mom, I put the rest here.

340
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:12,607
Hmm.

Tok! Tok!

345
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:54,345
Mom said Minako-san's grandma will worry,

346
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:56,855
if she is not home soon.

347
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:10,701
I will walk with you to the station.

348
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:36,723
Your mother gave it to me.

349
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:37,738
Hmm?

350
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:42,230
Lipstick.

351
00:26:47,742 --> 00:26:50,074
I'm still shy to use it.

352
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:57,450
This morning when I stepped out,

353
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:01,454
I said I might visit Koji-san's home,

354
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,581
then grandma told me something.

355
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,488
Hmm... what was it?

356
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:10,021
Koji-san is "national treasure".

357
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,656
What she mean by that?

358
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:17,663
That's why I should not like you very much.

359
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:23,677
My grandfather was killed
in the Russo-Japanese War.

360
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:27,145
Maybe she does not want me to have the same
lonely and tough life as her.

361
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,050
But..

362
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,146
I don't care even if she scolds me.

363
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,557
Mina-chan...

364
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,022
(Air Raid Sirens)

365
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:44,028
Come with me, hurry up!

366
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,361
Go inside the shelter!

367
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,401
Come on, hurry inside!

368
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:54,006
Come! Run quickly into the shelter!

369
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,144
Hurry up! Hurry up! Go inside!

370
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,908
"Hurry up!"

371
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,172
Excuse me.

372
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:09,185
The cook told me to send some fruit over.

373
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:13,485
- Please eat.
- Thank you.

374
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:18,727
Please eat.

375
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,030
Thank you.

376
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:31,577
Thank you.

377
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:47,025
Captain, surface noises have disappeared.

378
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,728
The enemy has gone.

379
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:59,532
Come to depth of 18 meters, and rise - quiet.

380
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,800
Floating!

381
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:02,406
Rising!

382
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,001
Down!

383
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:42,740
Okay, Surface!

384
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,409
Come to Surface!
Continue up!

385
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,718
Listen now! submarine point inspection!

386
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:54,989
The submarine has successfully
evaded enemy destroyers!

387
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,957
We made it!

388
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,097
We made it!

389
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,725
Hurry - check up on the "Kaiten".

390
00:30:00,735 --> 00:30:01,702
Yes.

391
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:04,767
Chihara! Chihara!

392
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,066
We made it!

393
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:06,864
Chihara!

394
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:07,636
Yes.

395
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,369
Quickly help me check the "Kaiten".

396
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:11,240
Go!

397
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:15,911
Tamano, be quick!

398
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,916
Sub-Lieutenant Namiki, let's
go up and check the craft.

399
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,051
Okay.

400
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:36,734
Open the hatch!

401
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:37,726
Yes.

402
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:09,200
Aargh...

403
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:23,277
How is it? Is there anything unusual?

404
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:26,320
No problem on the surface.

405
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,519
I will check inside.

406
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:35,794
Captain Kita.

407
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:38,723
Fourth boat severely damaged.

408
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,602
Hey, how about the no. 2 "Kaiten"?

409
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:52,434
There's no problem.

410
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:57,776
My "Kaiten's" outside seems also okay.
Now checking inside.

411
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,446
How about first one?

412
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,121
There's no problem.

413
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:08,723
Why?

414
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,294
Why?

415
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:27,672
Why my "boat"...

416
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:33,986
Chihara, do something.

417
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:44,030
Chihara, fix my craft!

418
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,824
Fix my "boat"....

419
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:04,949
Fix my "Kaiten"!

420
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:12,049
<flash back to>
Yokosuka Navy's Antisubmarine School

421
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,195
Salute!

422
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,010
There was a rumor going around.

423
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,716
But today we convened all over
to covince everyone;

424
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,250
that Japan's front-line officers & soldiers
are fighting courageously now.

425
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:51,395
But in facing strong enemy resistance,
the battle field has deteriorated further.

426
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,637
In order to cope with
this adverse situation,

427
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,837
we have developed special weapons
to annihilate the enemy.

428
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:10,910
These special weapons
will deal the enemy a devastating blow.

429
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:15,848
Because of their nature,
their use involves a high degree of danger.

430
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:22,927
Therefore, we need a fine soldier,

431
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,693
and a dynamic motivated pilot.

432
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:39,174
Those who wish to go into the
battle aboard this weapon,

433
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,215
please write your name
and draw two circles.

434
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:46,810
Those with no preference,
just name and one circle.

435
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:53,424
If you do not wish to volunteer,
write only your name.

436
00:34:54,195 --> 00:35:01,027
Despite this critical moment for Japan,
we look forward to your contribution.

437
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,330
That's all. You are finished.

438
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:05,900
Salute!

439
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:16,342
You have two hours to consider.

440
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,477
Those who want to volunteer,
fill out your slips and put into this box.

441
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:37,827
There is plenty of time!

442
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:41,738
You can decide elsewhere,
go to the living room or to the toilet.

443
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:35,660
"These special weapons..."

444
00:36:35,996 --> 00:36:39,261
"will deal the enemy a devastating blow."

445
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:44,832
"Because of their nature,
their use involves a high degree of danger."

456

I've only come to the Navy as a candidate.

457
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,734
I could not circle my slip.

460
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,368
Ready!

461
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:24,017
Turn Left... Move!

462
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,219
Ready! Run!

463
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:40,704
They said -
 "Kaiten" are  really torpedoes.

464
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,577
How could we ride it?

465
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:45,405
How about a one hit launch to heaven?

466
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:48,108
Shut up! Concentrate on training!

467
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,606
Too slow! --- faster!!

468
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,613
Stop... now!

469
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:28,351
We are going through the factory,
so keep it quiet!

470
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,346
Keep in line!

471
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:31,919
Yes.

472
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:11,164
Stop... Now!

473
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,932
Turn Right... Move!

474
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:25,272
Next you all...

475
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:27,274
are going to observe the Weapon.

476
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,906
Turn Left... Move!

477
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,899
Turn Left... Move!

478
00:43:07,854 --> 00:43:11,654
Later you are all going to
board this boat.

479
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:20,461
"The Return To Heaven"
will change the situation of the war.

480
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:22,929
That is why we called it "Kaiten".

481
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:31,609
There are 1.6 tons of explosives
in the front, packed inside.

482
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:38,041
It can blow up and sink
an aircraft carrier.

483
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:47,719
The "Kaiten" can make dozens, even hundreds
of enemy ships sink to the seabed.

484
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:52,921
Chief Officer Toyama will
explain the details.

485
00:43:56,203 --> 00:44:00,640
Length of this craft is 14.75 meters,
with a trunk diameter of 1.3 meter.

486
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,710
Engine has a double prop,
with 550 hp (horse power).

487
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,143
Normal speed 12 knots for 78 km range.

488
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:09,807
Maximum speed is 30 knots (56 km/hr).

489
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:15,548
Power control is based on the
renowned Type-93 oxygen torpedo.

490
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:19,887
With pure oxygen -
instead of air for fuel combustion,

491
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:22,584
it will not leave air bubbles on the sea.

492
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:25,997
This is the world's first
high-performance weapon.

493
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,560
However, use of hydrophones by the US,
allows hearing of motors underwater.

494
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,637
this makes effective use of torpedos difficult.

495
00:44:31,638 --> 00:44:35,301
That's why we made an improvement
to the Type-93 guidance controls.

496
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,450
With human control inside,

497
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:48,043
not only direction, but depth, and speed
can be changed with this craft.

498
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:52,754
You can avoid early detection, and it's use
against the enemy, now becomes possible.

499
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:54,693
I will say the most important thing is...

500
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:58,586
... That in the "Kaiten" -
 there is no way to escape.

501
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:00,937
That's all!

502
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,697
Complete your observations!

503
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:29,054
Kaiten is a device that uses
pure oxygen and oil.

504
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:33,264
Therefore it will produce a more powerful
high-pressure steam than usual.

505
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:37,359
This high-pressure steam will
set the piston in motion.

506
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:41,938
The disadvantage of high heat
generated when ignited,

507
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,569
could cause the piston and
cylinder to sieze by accident.

508
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:47,400
In order to prevent this mishap,

509
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:51,548
gradually increase the concentration
of oxygen and oil as needed.

510
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:56,116
However - if you reduce the burning of fuel,
and slow back <below the 5 knot normal speed>

511
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,387
"Kaiten" will stop !

512
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,925
Simply put, once your Kaiten
has launched...

513
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:07,431
 Until it hits the enemy ship and explodes,
it cannot  be stopped !!!

514
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:10,359
And of course this propulsion can't be
rotated in the reverse direction.

515
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:14,170
Which means, "Kaiten" cannot
go backwards <to the rear>.

516
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:16,301
It can only move forward.

517
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:33,506
Ensign Namiki.

518
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:36,920
My name is Ito.

519
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:43,402
You are the one who was sitting
inside the Kaiten, right?

520
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,301
What do you need from me?

521
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,602
You... Ensign is...

522
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,544
the Meiji University baseball
pitcher Namiki Koji, right?!

523
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:54,679
Do you know me?

524
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:55,973
Of course.

525
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:59,849
On the radio I kept following your winning
games during Summers at Koshien Univ.

526
00:47:01,254 --> 00:47:05,884
When I was in Junior High School, I saw
the Ensign's heroic game at Jingu Stadium.

527
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:08,653
You won 3 to nothing versus the Keio team,

528
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,129
Totally mind blowing.

529
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,926
You like baseball?

530
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,261
Very much.

531
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:18,395
I played first base in Junior High,

532
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:20,801
also did clean-up batting.

533
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:21,697
Really!

534
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:26,101
To be able to play
at Koshien Stadium was my dream.

535
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,111
and to see you is an honor.

536
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:31,911
I'm sorry to bother your learning time.

537
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:37,649
You are called Officer Ito, right?!

538
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:39,082
Yes.

539
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:43,889
Another time,
let's talk about baseball more.

540
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:45,296
Yes.

541
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:47,323
Also I was a major in literature;

542
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:50,467
but I am having trouble trying to
understand the structure of those devices.

543
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,836
Next time, please help me.

544
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,998
I will do anything I can.

545
00:47:55,475 --> 00:47:56,601
I must go now.

546
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:04,881
<Fourth Unit First Base Special Corps>

547
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:07,081
Start the electric vertical steering gear.

548
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:09,678
Open the operating empty plug valve.

549
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,491
Open the vertical steering gear valve.

550
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:15,158
Open the vertical steering
gear exhaust valve.

551
00:48:15,528 --> 00:48:17,462
Open the lubricants guide valve.

552
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,293
You won't able to set sail.

553
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,293
Huh?

554
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,495
You forgot to close vertical
steering gear relief valve.

555
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:27,738
You will die even before you hit the enemy.

556
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,306
Once more from the start.

557
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,467
Yes.

558
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:32,868
Start the electric vertical steering gear.

559
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,276
Open the operating empty plug valve.

560
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,907
Open the vertical steering gear valve.

561
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:40,993
Open the vertical steering
gear exhaust valve.

562
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:43,281
Close the vertical steering
gear relief valve.

563
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:45,850
Open the lubricants guide valve.

564
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,757
Hand rudder control...

565
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,355
It's on center.

566
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,996
Open the depth guide valve.

567
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,502
Depth gauge, no problem.

568
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,437
Depth zero meters.

569
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:04,068
Regulator 5 kilometers.

570
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,508
Height zero meters.

571
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:08,877
Open the fuel intermediate valve.

572
00:49:09,382 --> 00:49:10,849
Opening the valve...

573
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:15,047
Ah, that's too rough to open the valve.

574
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:18,318
Your way could cause an explosion,
you will be finished by then.

575
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:22,121
Listen carefully, there's
pure oxygen inside.

576
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:24,625
A point you should clearly put into your head.

577
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:25,620
Yes.

578
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,199
Okay, once more from the start.

579
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,298
Yes.

580
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:32,684
Start the electric vertical steering gear.

581
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:35,966
Open the operating empty plug valve.

582
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:38,270
Start the electric vertical steering gear.

583
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:40,572
Open the operating empty plug valve.

584
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,021
The longitudinal steering gear exhaust...
no,  not right.

585
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,807
Open the vertical steering gear valve.

586
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,821
Open the vertical steering
gear exhaust valve.

587
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:48,811
Close the vertical steering
gear relief valve.

588
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:51,669
Open the lubricants guide valve.

589
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,359
Hand rudder control... on the center...

590
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,293
Ensign Namiki.

591
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,456
I thought I would find you here.

592
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:00,328
What about that?

593
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:05,628
With my fellow comrade from Tokyo,
both of us secretly brought them here.

594
00:50:05,972 --> 00:50:10,341
I want to catch Ensign Namiki's pitch.

595
00:50:11,244 --> 00:50:13,838
Can we see the ball in this moonlight?

596
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:15,814
Leave it to me.

597
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,055
It's really been a long time.

598
00:50:57,323 --> 00:50:59,791
Please don't pitch the fast ball!

599
00:50:59,859 --> 00:51:01,191
Makes me nervous.

600
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:14,571
My shoulder had been injured.

601
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:18,670
I couldn't pitch the ball as
fast as my pitch in the Jingu games.

602
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:21,971
So now I have to challenge
myself with new throws.

603
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,446
Then I will catch your new stuff.

604
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:32,417
It's not complete yet.

605
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:51,232
Ah!

606
00:52:05,758 --> 00:52:07,225
You are Kita!

607
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,199
So, you're really Namiki.
I heard you were assigned here.

608
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:14,630
When did you get here?

609
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:16,395
I arrived yesterday from Kinosuke.

610
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:18,129
So, we are on same mission?

611
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:20,365
Right, as "Kaiten" pilots.

612
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:23,339
How is the training going?
Controlling "Kaiten" is difficult, right?

613
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:27,377
Do it right!

614
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:29,713
Hey, Kita!

615
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:31,741
What?

616
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:34,945
Now you're still running?

617
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:38,119
I only run because...

618
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:41,989
as a soldier I have to keep my
body ready to face the mission.

619
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:45,187
Listen, I'm a Navy Sub-Lieutenant in here.

620
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:47,465
Beware of your language.

621
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:53,636
Do you know Sub-Lieutenant Kita?

622
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:56,740
Yeah...
 We were classmates at the University.

623
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:02,414
Sub-Lieutenant Kita went
on a mission last month.

624
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:04,553
But his boat was unable
to launch due to...

625
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:06,737
...mechanical problems, then
he ended up here.

626
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:11,288
Really... he already went on a mission.

627
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:21,465
Listen!

628
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:25,235
From now on this is the most critical part.

629
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:33,278
When the enemy is just one kilometer away,
with the periscope make a last observation.

630
00:53:34,614 --> 00:53:36,809
After checking  final position and speed,

631
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,509
and from a depth of 4 meters,

632
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:44,849
hit the central part of the
enemy ship using full maximum speed.

633
00:53:45,925 --> 00:53:50,225
In other words after the final observation,

634
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:55,557
it will depend on your own
judgement to set course and cruise speed.

635
00:53:57,303 --> 00:54:02,070
This training, sooner or later, will give
you a sense of the biggest problems.

636
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:06,372
With fuel consumption,
your boat will gradually become lighter.

637
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:09,471
and slowly it will lose its depth.

638
00:54:09,615 --> 00:54:12,607
So you will need to regularly
monitor the oxygen meter,

639
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,285
and  inject sea water,
to adjust the buoyancy to keep from rising.

640
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:23,353
If you fail to do this, then your Kaiten
will begin to nose up and down...

641
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:26,364
Commonly known as the "Dolphin" Movement.

642
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,729
If the nose gets out of the water,
the enemy can see  it.

643
00:54:29,736 --> 00:54:31,765
On the contrary, if the nose
goes down too deep,

644
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:34,399
your Kaiten will not be able to pull out.

645
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:37,506
You will just continue down...
...sink to the bottom and wait to die.

646
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:40,306
Idiots !!!

647
00:54:40,546 --> 00:54:42,440
Don't be dazing around!

648
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:43,727
Didn't you  hear me?

649
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,510
Yes!

650
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:57,128

00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:16,214
Yes.

659
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,583
Solo?
No instructor onboard during this training?

660
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:19,551
Yes.

661
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:22,045
Be very cautious!

662
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:26,121
No matter what happens, do not panic!

663
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:27,317
Yes.

664
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:29,352
Go!

665
00:56:03,963 --> 00:56:08,024
When the hatch is closed
I'll give signal "gong-gong-gong".

666
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:11,631
If there is no problem with your
boat, I'll give another "gong-gong-gong".

667
00:56:11,904 --> 00:56:15,237
Then you will reply with
your signal "gong-gong-gong".

668
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:18,399
After 10 seconds, we will release the boat.

00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,012

Depth gauge, no problem.
Depth zero meters.

684
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:33,812
Regulator...

685
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:37,783
5 kilometers.

686
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,290

694
00:58:15,795 --> 00:58:17,768
I heard the signal.

695
00:58:17,852 --> 00:58:19,701
For now - concentrate on your boat.

696
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:23,101
Be careful. I pray for your safety.

697
00:58:59,632 --> 00:59:07,632
(♪ Humming Maurice Ravel's 'Bolero' ♪)

698
00:59:37,576 --> 00:59:40,807
Turn right after reaching Sejima base,
full right  rudder for 30 seconds,

699
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:43,579
then full right rudder for 50 seconds.

700
00:59:44,317 --> 00:59:46,007
Proceed to destination...

701
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:53,754
Report, Okay Status
to launch Unit No.35

702
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:57,359
Keep your eyes on that Kaiten!

703
00:59:57,463 --> 00:59:58,452
Yes.

704
01:00:15,848 --> 01:00:22,447
5...4...3...2...1... launch!

705
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:39,708
Pull the the operating empty plug valve...
or vertical steering gear valve...

706
01:00:40,405 --> 01:00:41,633
Starting valve?

707
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:48,304
Regulators section...

708
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:03,353
Fast! Too fast!

709
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:08,017
What is he doing suddenly!

710
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,097
He have might set the regulator too high.

711
01:01:12,537 --> 01:01:14,027
Catch up with him!

712
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:22,580
What's wrong with him?
"Quick - dive down!"

713
01:01:24,316 --> 01:01:27,979
Okay, I am diving down.

714
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,884
Keep this up for 5 minutes...

715
01:01:39,264 --> 01:01:44,201
Depth of 15 meters?
This is bad, very bad!

716
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:50,804
Ah, this is bad!

717
01:01:57,883 --> 01:02:00,813
Ah, the 'Dolphin' Movement!

718
01:02:00,986 --> 01:02:02,647
This is dangerous.

719
01:02:03,655 --> 01:02:08,183
Turn full right! Full speed!

720
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,294
Ah, I am finally going up!

721
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:27,375
Okay.

722
01:02:45,764 --> 01:02:47,759
There's no Sejima base?

723
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,202
Strange.

724
01:02:58,043 --> 01:03:00,034
Was my direction wrong?

725
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:07,615
Okay, let's turn right.

726
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:10,848
Found the Kaiten!

727
01:03:10,956 --> 01:03:13,447
On the right, 70°, sailing
towards the base.

728
01:03:14,493 --> 01:03:16,984
Full right on the rudder!

729
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:24,092
Reaching Sejima Base in 3 minutes.

730
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:26,892
Okay!

731
01:03:30,142 --> 01:03:31,440
It's about to hit!

732
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:32,676
Idiot!

733
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:34,336
Resound gunshot two times!

734
01:03:34,446 --> 01:03:35,413
Yes.

735
01:03:39,851 --> 01:03:41,944
Stop? It's a stop signal!

736
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:02,172
Aaagh!

737
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,574
Hey.

738
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,926
Report, Ensign Namiki has completed
Kaiten control training.

739
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,100
You made us worry!

740
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:15,808
Just a bit more inepttitude
and it would have caused your death!

741
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:17,608
You damn fool!

742
01:05:17,849 --> 01:05:19,714
I'm really sorry.

743
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:32,227
Damn!

744
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:38,595
I only practiced once or twice,
how could you remember it all.

745
01:05:41,873 --> 01:05:43,704
Aaargh!

746
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,089
Mom!

747
01:06:47,572 --> 01:06:48,800
What's the matter?

748
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,238
It's me!

749
01:06:56,547 --> 01:07:00,449
I was just thinking of you.

750
01:07:02,286 --> 01:07:04,151
I thought this was a dream.

751
01:07:04,255 --> 01:07:05,655
Fool...

752
01:07:05,656 --> 01:07:06,680
Welcome back.

753
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:07,687
Hmm.

754
01:07:07,692 --> 01:07:08,750
Hurry come inside.

755
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,758
Okay.

756
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:15,961
You look so fine.

757
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:18,322
I will follow you soon.

758
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:19,336
Hmm.

759
01:07:25,443 --> 01:07:28,810
Brother, you look handsome
in the uniform.

760
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:32,979
Eh... you really grew a lot.

761
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:34,975
Brother too.

762
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:37,378
I won't grow taller than this.

763
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:39,622
Eh... but you do become taller.

764
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:43,120
What are you younger ones doing?

765
01:07:43,728 --> 01:07:46,856
You must be surprised
everywhere was burned.

766
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:51,664
Shimada-san's, Tsumi-san's,
Kogure-san's house all burned down.

767
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:55,227
Hmm...
bombing raids really are frightening.

768
01:07:56,307 --> 01:07:58,400
Right, I need to send a telegram.

769
01:07:58,509 --> 01:07:59,533
To who?

770
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:02,306
Of course for Minako-san.

771
01:08:04,615 --> 01:08:08,813
Do you know, Minako-san's house
also got hit from a bombing raid.

772
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,481
So she lives temporarily with
relatives in Hachioji now.

773
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,923
Mom, please give the money
to send a telegram.

774
01:08:18,696 --> 01:08:20,755
Hey, Sachi...

775
01:08:23,334 --> 01:08:24,494
Sachi!

776
01:08:25,002 --> 01:08:26,196
What?

777
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:30,007
Brother has only one night at home.

778
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:33,599
Heh... one night only?!

779
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:37,511
I could only come to Tokyo for a day.

780
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:41,179
That's why you don't have
to call Mina-chan and...

781
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:43,550
On the contrary, that's exactly
why we should call her.

782
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:47,251
If we don't message her, she
certainly will hate you.

783
01:08:49,894 --> 01:08:51,156
I'm going.

784
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:59,497
- So -
We have 'suiton' dumpling soup for dinner.

785
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:03,905
Sorry, even when you
specially come back home...

786
01:09:04,008 --> 01:09:06,033
We don't have white rice to cook.

787
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:10,547
I already asked everywhere to buy some,
but they said no.

788
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:12,172
Here.

789
01:09:16,454 --> 01:09:19,682
Brother, this is for you.

790
01:09:25,963 --> 01:09:28,523
Ah, Obata's glove.

791
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:32,359
It's a momento... of Obata-san.

792
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:33,826
What?

793
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:37,531
The transport ship he was riding,

794
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:40,873
got hit by US submarine torpedoes.

795
01:09:41,212 --> 01:09:44,875
The ship carried about 1,000 Japanese army,

796
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:49,214
Obata-san is one of them.

797
01:09:50,054 --> 01:09:54,252
Early last month, his sister come here...

798
01:09:55,826 --> 01:09:59,227
She said "it is because my brother..."
"...really liked Namiki as a friend."

799
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,298
"He must hope that Namiki will keep it."

800
01:10:01,499 --> 01:10:03,433
Strike! However, nothing's changed!

801
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:07,935
He was really a considerate kind boy.

802
01:10:10,775 --> 01:10:13,209
Always grinning happily.

803
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:15,775
I only came to the Navy as a candidate.

804
01:10:16,914 --> 01:10:18,905
I could not draw a circle.

805
01:10:23,054 --> 01:10:25,318
Hey, let's just eat for now.

806
01:10:39,437 --> 01:10:41,598
I wonder what happened with Minako-san.

807
01:10:41,706 --> 01:10:44,539
The telegram should
have been sent.

808
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:48,176
Are there any bombing raids in Hachioji?

809
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:51,476
I listen to the news on the radio,
seems there hasn't been any lately.

810
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:58,351
Recently there are air raid sirens
every night,

811
01:10:58,456 --> 01:11:01,254
We could not even change to
pajamas and have a good sleep.

812
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:04,084
You must always stay alert
in your clothes.

813
01:11:06,163 --> 01:11:09,599
Brother, why don't we go to Hachioji?!

814
01:11:11,202 --> 01:11:14,069
It's better not to meet.

815
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,200
Why?

816
01:11:17,308 --> 01:11:20,004
Did you lose your feeling for Minako-san?

817
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:23,171
That's not the case... I love her.

818
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,505
So why...

819
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:29,347
No matter what happens,
you do want to meet with her, right?

820
01:11:31,522 --> 01:11:33,012
It's so strange.

821
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:37,288
Since you came home, you don't
care whether to see her or not.

822
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:41,524
Sachi, Koji is a soldier now.

823
01:11:42,266 --> 01:11:44,496
The one who dedicates his
life to the country.

824
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,398
He does not know when it's
time to give his life.

825
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:50,131
That is why...

826
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:53,208
It would be better not to meet.

827
01:11:53,944 --> 01:11:55,275
That's exactly why!

828
01:11:56,847 --> 01:12:01,682
If this is really the last time, then they
should do anything to meet again.

829
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:07,252
Just because you are going to die,
you just give up.

830
01:12:08,092 --> 01:12:10,583
If my lover did this...

831
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:13,288
I will loudly scold him,
"you betray me".

832
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:16,263
This is just nonsense.

833
01:12:17,435 --> 01:12:20,734
Don't you feel sorry for Minako-san?

834
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:40,150
Father, it's Koji.

835
01:12:40,257 --> 01:12:41,019
Hmm.

836
01:12:56,307 --> 01:13:01,448
Father, this is the watch
you gave me.

837
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:02,644
I give it back to you.

838
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,508
It will be a waste if I keep it.

839
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,821
You are really going?

840
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:18,560
I must do it for Obata's sake.

841
01:13:19,497 --> 01:13:23,635
But also to protect you Father,
Mom and Sachi.

842
01:13:23,661 --> 01:13:27,522
And to protect everyone from the enemy.

843
01:13:28,372 --> 01:13:32,706
When you say 'the enemy', you mean
the US and UK people?

844
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:36,507
China, France, Netherlands,
all are our enemies.

845
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:41,447
Have you ever seen the enemy?

846
01:13:45,256 --> 01:13:47,747
When you father was in junior high school,

847
01:13:49,093 --> 01:13:52,290
there was this American teacher
called "McBain".

848
01:13:52,363 --> 01:13:55,264
A fine man, he had a great sense of humor.

849
01:13:55,366 --> 01:13:59,894
This is not about each individual person.
This is a war between countries.

850
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,400
Koji.

851
01:14:07,011 --> 01:14:09,536
I wonder what they mean
to called it a country.

852
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,846
Country is the state.

853
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,514
Like Japan, the United States,

854
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,684
France, the United Kingdom...

855
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:26,128
You don't have to return it.

856
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,326
Keep it.

857
01:14:30,935 --> 01:14:32,800
Keep it as an amulet.

858
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:46,439
I will be the one who tells your Mother.

859
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:52,148
So it's true. You are really going...

860
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:56,584
For the country's sake.

861
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:07,332
"No. 5 Train, from Tokyo to
Osaka, will depart soon."

862
01:15:07,438 --> 01:15:10,498
"All train passengers please enter
through the nearest entrance".

863
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:14,274
I will be going.

864
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,647
Keep your body healthy.

865
01:15:17,748 --> 01:15:19,272
Where is Minako-san...

866
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:22,712
I already told her the place and
time when you leave on the telegram.

867
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,620
Maybe something happened.

868
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:27,352
I will look for her.

869
01:15:32,563 --> 01:15:35,828
Mom, I will write you a letter.

870
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,897
Yes, you must write me.

871
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:46,169
If I do not receive your letter,
I will be very worried about you.

872
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:48,403
"Mother!"

873
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:54,044
"Brother!"

874
01:15:54,652 --> 01:15:57,052
"Excuse me."

875
01:15:58,188 --> 01:15:59,621
"Excuse me."

876
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,665
You are very mean!
Why leave before seeing me?

877
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,397
That's not what I meant to do.

878
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:20,574
Mina-chan.

879
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:31,582
I am very worried. Could you tell me...

880
01:16:31,822 --> 01:16:33,873
There are headlines
appearing in the newspapers.

881
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:35,749
You're not joining
a 'Kamikaze team', right?

882
01:16:37,494 --> 01:16:39,587
Ah, is that true?

883
01:16:39,897 --> 01:16:42,661
The military information is secret;
but I will be fine.

884
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,461
You will take some boat?

885
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:49,100
So it's not dangerous?

886
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:54,203
I feel more comfortable now.

887
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:56,939
There was labor mobilization
in the factory.

888
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:58,947
That's why I could not see you last night.

889
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,684
We will meet again, right?

890
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:03,386
Yes.

891
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:07,718
Promise me, you must inform me
when you're back home.

892
01:17:07,825 --> 01:17:11,818
I love you, Mina-chan!

893
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:52,660
How is the crew doing?

894
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:56,997
Joking around and playing trump card.

895
01:17:58,809 --> 01:18:02,245
One day we will encounter the enemy soon.

896
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:05,610
Then we would commit "Kaiten" to attack.

897
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:10,885
Honestly, it won't be easy.
Because we know that they are going to die.

898
01:18:12,389 --> 01:18:16,587
They certainly have
parents and siblings too.

899
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,574
I don't have children, so I don't really
understand how parent's feel,

900
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:25,498
But I keep thinking they are dear to me.

901
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:37,579
Ah... this feels good.

902
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,410
Hey, Okita.

903
01:18:42,252 --> 01:18:44,618
You haven't eaten anything since morning.

904
01:18:44,755 --> 01:18:46,120
You will just ruin yourself.

905
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,747
Leave him be.

906
01:18:48,692 --> 01:18:51,092
To comfort him this time,
is just adding salt to the wound.

907
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:52,320
Rise up!

908
01:19:07,377 --> 01:19:11,575
What is so fun about
looking into a mirror like that?

909
01:19:12,049 --> 01:19:16,213
I feel more and more like my mother.

910
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,618
How about your father?

911
01:19:19,456 --> 01:19:22,584
My father's face looks like a crab.

912
01:19:22,693 --> 01:19:26,291
I really don't want to look like him.

913
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:30,589
Think about it, my mother is a beauty.

914
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,459
It's a good thing my face resembles hers.

915
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,596
But gradually I become a man
who will look like his mother.

916
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:39,437
You're a fool...

917
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:46,639
I don't care who you resemble the most,
stop this useless conversation.

918
01:19:51,855 --> 01:19:55,188
Hey, Okita, you are pretty good at singing.

919
01:19:56,426 --> 01:19:57,484
Sing a song.

920
01:19:57,594 --> 01:19:59,118
Oh... right.

921
01:19:59,229 --> 01:20:00,856
I miss hearing you sing.

922
01:20:01,365 --> 01:20:04,027
Sing! That is an order!

923
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:07,528
Yes.

924
01:20:10,607 --> 01:20:11,733
I will sing.

925
01:20:11,842 --> 01:20:14,538

They can not go back home.

Even for us there's no guarantee
we will return home safely.

That's true.

Okita.

952
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:02,577
I'm glad I could hear your
singing for the last time.

953
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:12,978
Don't give up. Keep your spirit high.

954
01:23:22,933 --> 01:23:24,127
Farewell.

955

Let's go.

957
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:08,038
Thank you for taking care of me until now.

We also talked a lot about baseball.

01:25:56,286 --> 01:25:58,254
Can you hear me clearly, Namiki?

963
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:01,422
Sub-Lieutenant Namiki, can you hear us?

964
01:26:01,725 --> 01:26:03,283
Very clear.

965
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,352

971
01:26:57,981 --> 01:27:01,348
The enemy is a large transport ship
off the bow.

972
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:08,313

speed ​​of 14 knots.

973
01:27:09,492 --> 01:27:10,959
An azimuth of 100°.

974
01:27:11,861 --> 01:27:13,829
Latitude 290°.

975
01:27:14,064 --> 01:27:16,225
Speed of 20 knots for 12 minutes.

976
01:27:16,366 --> 01:27:19,501
The target is a large transport ship -
off the bow.

977
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:23,628
Only one ship... who will go?

978
01:27:26,743 --> 01:27:28,335
First boat will be sent.

979
01:27:28,778 --> 01:27:31,747
Lieutenant Kita,
We wish you bring us victory.

980
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:34,612
First boat, We wish you bring us victory.

981
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:36,244
Kita...

982
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:38,378
First boat set sail!

983
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:40,081
Go!

984
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:42,658
First boat set sail! Go!

985
01:27:48,732 --> 01:27:49,790
Kita...

986
01:27:50,233 --> 01:27:52,565
What happened? Answer me, Kita!

987
01:27:52,669 --> 01:27:55,365
Lieutenant Kita, please answer!

988
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:58,340
Set sail...

989
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:00,940
Failed.

990
01:28:04,647 --> 01:28:07,172
First boat, set sail failed.

991
01:28:11,221 --> 01:28:13,849
Got it! First boat, set sail failed!

992
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:17,888
Captain, please let me go! Captain!

993
01:28:18,528 --> 01:28:21,292
Second Boat Set Sail! Go!

994
01:28:21,598 --> 01:28:24,431
Second Boat Set Sail! Go!

995
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,334
"Mother..."

996
01:28:34,144 --> 01:28:35,088
"Aaaargh!"

997
01:29:19,289 --> 01:29:20,916
Target hit confirmed!

998
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:42,643
Captain! Please tell me the next target!

999
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:45,908
Enemy transport ship has sank.

1000
01:29:46,249 --> 01:29:48,945
There's no more enemy?

1001
01:29:50,987 --> 01:29:53,979
Captain, third boat wants
to search for the enemy.

1002
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,184
Tell him to calm down.
Attack mission has ended.

1003
01:29:57,293 --> 01:30:00,285
Tell Kita and Namiki to
return to submarine.

1004
01:30:03,266 --> 01:30:05,632
For now keep the transport
drainage tubes clear.

1005
01:30:06,269 --> 01:30:07,293
Down!

1006
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:14,233
I have something I want to ask you.

1007
01:31:15,705 --> 01:31:17,432
What about?

1008
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,732
If it's about Kaiten, I will listen.

1009
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:24,578
Please change your boat with me.

1010
01:31:26,349 --> 01:31:27,389
Don't do something stupid.

1011
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:29,647
Then give me your pity.

1012
01:31:30,353 --> 01:31:33,147
We could force your boat to
accommodate two people.

1013
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:35,883
Let me go along with you.

1014
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,717
Keep your sense!

1015
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:40,492
That's just dying in vain.

1016
01:31:40,964 --> 01:31:46,459
You can proudly strike back
on the next mission.

1017
01:31:47,437 --> 01:31:48,533
Too late.

1018
01:31:48,538 --> 01:31:50,096
What do you mean?

1019
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,167
Japan is losing.

1020
01:31:53,376 --> 01:31:56,038
So there won't be much
opportunity to attack.

1021
01:31:58,281 --> 01:32:00,306
When the war comes to an end,

1022
01:32:00,883 --> 01:32:03,569
I will be living in disgrace,
I already went

1023
01:32:03,595 --> 01:32:06,005
on two missions, and still returned alive.

1024
01:32:07,423 --> 01:32:14,829
How am I  suppose to face
my subordinates, my superior...

1025
01:32:15,431 --> 01:32:17,889
the people in my hometown as well.

1026
01:32:22,338 --> 01:32:23,900
I'm begging you.

1027
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:27,533
Just do it out of sympathy.

1028
01:32:29,979 --> 01:32:31,947
You're really strange.

1029
01:32:34,017 --> 01:32:35,814
Keep your head up!

1030
01:32:36,653 --> 01:32:39,679
Now is my only chance to become a war hero!

1031
01:32:41,024 --> 01:32:42,218
War hero?

1032
01:32:43,226 --> 01:32:45,751
Being in Special Attack Corps
is the highest honor.

1033
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:48,156
I could become a hero.

1034
01:32:49,032 --> 01:32:52,490
Do you really want to achieve that?

1035
01:32:52,602 --> 01:32:57,130
I was raised on a poor tenant farm,
unlike you.

1036
01:32:58,808 --> 01:33:01,675
So it doesn't matter how -
I must provide for my family.

1037
01:33:03,713 --> 01:33:06,614
I was to become a marathon runner
for the same reason.

1038
01:33:10,353 --> 01:33:14,517
However, that dream got shattered too.

1039
01:33:15,391 --> 01:33:16,619
Dream?

1040
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:33,900
Now my only way is to become a war hero.

1041
01:33:36,112 --> 01:33:37,409
I'm begging you.

1042
01:33:44,287 --> 01:33:47,688
Kita, calm down.

1043
01:33:48,391 --> 01:33:50,518
Calm down and think about it clearly.

1044
01:33:51,327 --> 01:33:54,387
Your way will be the same as suicide.

1045
01:33:55,231 --> 01:33:57,665
Is a suicidal person a war hero?

1046
01:33:58,334 --> 01:33:59,801
It's wrong, right?

1047
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:06,834
Remember what for we went through
- such hard work on Kaiten training.

1048
01:34:08,177 --> 01:34:10,668
Only to have a useless death?

1049
01:34:11,414 --> 01:34:12,540
Kita!

1050
01:34:16,552 --> 01:34:18,213
It's wrong, right?

1051
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:52,407
< Altar for: Yasukichi Sakuma>
<Pilot of 2nd.Kaiten unit>

1052
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:06,392
"Enemy ships sighted!"

1053
01:35:06,402 --> 01:35:07,530
"Everyone to your position!"

1054
01:35:07,536 --> 01:35:09,768
"To your positions!"

1055
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:10,861
Hurry! Hurry!

1056
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:11,965
Hurry up!

1057
01:35:12,074 --> 01:35:13,234
Hurry! Hurry!

1058
01:35:14,677 --> 01:35:15,666
Hurry up!

1059
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:20,212
Prepare Next Kaiten!

1060
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:22,210
Pilot Into His Boat!

1061
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:25,286
Prepare For Kaiten! Pilot Into His Boat!

1062
01:35:26,155 --> 01:35:27,417
I will go.

1063
01:36:25,081 --> 01:36:27,777
Third boat, Namiki here.

1064
01:36:28,184 --> 01:36:32,086
The enemy is a fleet of 5 ships
off the bow.

1065
01:36:33,389 --> 01:36:36,324
From the right 25°, distance 8000m.

1066
01:36:36,425 --> 01:36:38,188
Wait for my command before setting sail.

1067
01:36:38,828 --> 01:36:40,423
Start speed at 12 knots.

1068
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:44,323
Azimuth of 90°, latitude of 170°.

1069
01:36:44,433 --> 01:36:46,799
Keep speed at 20 knots for 14 minutes.

1070
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:51,665
Namiki.

1071
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:55,272
Any last words?

1072
01:37:12,628 --> 01:37:14,459
Namiki!

1073
01:37:45,461 --> 01:37:52,869
Thank you for keeping me me safe upto now.

1074
01:37:54,603 --> 01:37:59,438
- I wish for you all -
to have a peaceful life.

1075
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:07,513
Third Boat, Prepare For Set Sail!

1076
01:38:09,852 --> 01:38:13,754
Third boat, ready for set sail! Okay!

1077
01:38:14,857 --> 01:38:18,020
Third Boat Set Sail! Go!

1078
01:38:18,194 --> 01:38:20,788
Third Boat Set Sail! Go!

1079
01:38:41,984 --> 01:38:43,144
Namiki!

1080
01:38:44,086 --> 01:38:45,417
Could you set sail?

1081
01:38:46,022 --> 01:38:48,047
Answer, Namiki!

1082
01:38:48,157 --> 01:38:50,489
Third boat, please answer!

1083
01:38:51,861 --> 01:38:53,829
It Failed to launch!

1084
01:38:56,599 --> 01:38:59,932
We've been discovered by the enemy!
Abort the attack!

1085
01:39:00,036 --> 01:39:02,596
Order Namiki exit Kaiten
and return here immediately!

1086
01:39:02,705 --> 01:39:05,674
We've been discovered by the enemy!
Abort the attack!

1087
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:52,112
Sub-Lieutenant Namiki, your ball...

1088
01:39:57,827 --> 01:39:59,192
What are you laughing at!

1089
01:40:03,699 --> 01:40:05,599
I'm sorry!

1090
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:38,327
<After Lieutenant Namiki's Kaiten failed,>

1091
01:40:38,467 --> 01:40:41,331
<the Kaiten attack mission was suspended.>

1092
01:40:41,409 --> 01:40:45,837
<We've been ordered>
<to return to Hikari Base.>

1093
01:40:47,076 --> 01:40:50,411
<During our return>
<on the abundant surface of ocean...>

1094
01:40:50,413 --> 01:40:53,814
<we passed the great battleship Yamato>
<which sailed towards Okinawa.>

1095
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:57,542
<Their mission was called>
<"Ten-ichi-gō" (or "Heavenly One")...>

1096
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:00,453
<they were to defend the island,>
with no aircraft to cover them.>

1097
01:41:00,457 --> 01:41:04,093
<We sadly paid our respects as they>
<rushed forward to their suicide defense.>

1098
01:41:04,094 --> 01:41:05,756
<we shout and we waved>

1099
01:41:08,964 --> 01:41:13,663
<Back at the base, Sub-Lt. Namiki>
<was treated as an outcast.>

1100
01:41:15,104 --> 01:41:17,504
<"How dare he come back alive?">

1101
01:41:17,873 --> 01:41:20,637
<Those rude and unreasonable eyes>
<looked at Sub-Lieutenant Namiki,>

1102
01:41:21,177 --> 01:41:24,237
<made me very upset,>

1103
01:41:26,348 --> 01:41:29,814
<as I'm the one who caused Sub-Lt. Namiki
<to fail at his duty.>

1104
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:33,154
<He didn't even complain>
<that it was my fault - that he failed.>

1105
01:41:33,155 --> 01:41:34,449
Sub-Lieutenant Namiki.

1106
01:41:34,757 --> 01:41:38,693
<I felt very bad about this.>

1107
01:41:39,295 --> 01:41:41,058
Let's play catch.

1108
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:43,858
(Obata's Glove)

1109
01:41:53,909 --> 01:41:54,967
Sub-Lieutenant.

1110
01:41:57,112 --> 01:42:03,073
Ito, when the war comes to an end
what are you going to do?

1111
01:42:05,688 --> 01:42:09,784
I will become a teacher,

1112
01:42:10,759 --> 01:42:15,753
Return to my high school and
teach kids to play baseball.

1113
01:42:16,398 --> 01:42:19,993
You want to go to Koshien.
That's a good one.

1114
01:42:20,903 --> 01:42:22,803
Germany has already surrendered.

1115
01:42:22,805 --> 01:42:23,630
Yes.

1116
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:25,266
Japan will surrender as well.

1117
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:28,609
Why would you say that?

1118
01:42:28,978 --> 01:42:32,409
Have you ever seen what
the enemy looks like?

1119
01:42:35,651 --> 01:42:37,075
No.

1120
01:42:37,453 --> 01:42:39,785
We label them "the enemy" but...

1121
01:42:40,456 --> 01:42:43,913
Even their sailors love
to play baseball.

1122
01:42:43,939 --> 01:42:47,250
They also have family and
lovers waiting for them.

1123
01:42:49,098 --> 01:42:53,728
Sinking the enemy ship means
taking that away from them.

1124
01:42:56,005 --> 01:42:56,994
Sorry.

1125
01:43:05,581 --> 01:43:06,843
Sub-Lieutenant...

1126
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:11,342
You're not really thinking that,

1127
01:43:11,453 --> 01:43:14,294
...because Japan will soon surrender,
we don't need to launch "Kaiten".

1128
01:43:16,792 --> 01:43:22,594
By the time Japan loses the war,
I will already be dead.

1129
01:43:25,167 --> 01:43:27,362
Hey! pass the ball over.

1130
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:36,077
But we created "Kaiten" as special
weapons to defend the country.

1131
01:43:36,211 --> 01:43:40,272
To protect the country, to win the war
that's the purpose for riding "Kaiten".

1132
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:41,713
Don't you think so?

1133
01:43:41,817 --> 01:43:43,682
That's impossible.

1134
01:43:43,786 --> 01:43:46,350
So why is Sub-Lieutenant Namiki doing this?

1135
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:48,718
If you ask me...

1136
01:43:49,758 --> 01:43:52,488
You want to know why I need to die, right?

1137
01:43:53,128 --> 01:43:55,028
That's the problem...

1138
01:44:00,569 --> 01:44:06,530
I will die in order to convey...
the meaning of "Kaiten" to others.

1139
01:44:13,749 --> 01:44:16,877
This special weapon
called the "human torpedo",

1140
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:20,952
has a real person as part of the weapon.

1141
01:44:21,357 --> 01:44:26,260
I will die for people to
understand these sad facts.

1142
01:44:27,463 --> 01:44:28,760
That's enough for me.

1143
01:44:34,169 --> 01:44:37,627
This is just my personal reason.

1144
01:44:38,006 --> 01:44:40,440
Okay, I will change the pitch.

1145
01:44:57,793 --> 01:45:00,455
Hey, did you see that?

1146
01:45:00,796 --> 01:45:02,161
It curved!

1147
01:45:02,197 --> 01:45:03,056
Yes.

1148
01:45:03,065 --> 01:45:05,465
That's it! That's my magic ball!

1149
01:45:05,467 --> 01:45:06,326
Yes!

1150
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:08,428
Ito, that was my magic ball!

1151
01:45:08,537 --> 01:45:11,529
This has been a long time dream!

1152
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:43,301
<On the next day...>

1153
01:45:44,740 --> 01:45:47,071
<A second attack mission was being prepared.>

1154
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:49,871
<Soon there was to be joint training.>

1155
01:45:51,313 --> 01:45:54,345
<If there wasn't joint training,>
<Namiki probably would still be... alive.>

1156
01:45:55,484 --> 01:46:00,547
<Lieutenant Namiki made a practice run,>
<even though he had contracted a fever.>

1157
01:46:12,401 --> 01:46:15,996
<August 15th, 1945,>

1158
01:46:16,104 --> 01:46:18,164
<Japan surrendered to the Allies>
<unconditionally.>

1159
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:23,801
<But it was already too late.>
<His craft with too much ballast, drove to the bottom.>

1160
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:25,977
<A bit later in September of that year...>

1161
01:46:26,715 --> 01:46:31,778
<A Makurazaki typhoon swept away>
<most of the facilites of the Seto Inland Sea.>

1162
01:47:53,836 --> 01:47:55,661
Hurry up!

1163
01:47:55,705 --> 01:47:57,670
Come on! Let's go!

1164
01:49:47,449 --> 01:49:49,007
Namiki-san.

1165
01:49:53,522 --> 01:49:55,490
Namiki-san!

1166
01:49:58,827 --> 01:50:00,294
Why?

1167
01:50:02,864 --> 01:50:06,630
Why?
Why did you have to die?

1168
01:50:17,612 --> 01:50:22,379
Probably because I will
lose consciousness soon...

1169
01:50:23,318 --> 01:50:27,118
Outside it is probably a very sunny day,
or it is already night.

1170
01:50:27,289 --> 01:50:30,215
And of what color the skies might be?

1171
01:50:31,159 --> 01:50:34,128
I keep thinking these things in my mind...

1172
01:50:39,134 --> 01:50:45,266
Ito-kun, on the last mission I struck you.

1173
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:48,540
I feel very guilty and sad.

1174
01:50:49,478 --> 01:50:53,380
But truthfully,
at that time, I was relieved.

1175
01:50:54,616 --> 01:50:57,813
I who had a determination to die,
    - actually -

1176
01:50:58,386 --> 01:51:00,479
...was really very scared.

1177
01:51:01,823 --> 01:51:04,724
When I saw your smiling face,

1178
01:51:05,494 --> 01:51:08,190
I felt as tho you could see thru
to what was inside my heart.

1179
01:51:09,498 --> 01:51:14,367
Who I really wanted to strike - was myself.

1180
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:17,332
I am the one who is to be sorry.

1181
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:28,110
Trying to keep consciousness,

1182
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:34,147
I don't even realize what
I have written.

1183
01:51:50,839 --> 01:51:54,297
<Mom, the ocean is with me now.>

1184
01:51:56,711 --> 01:52:01,205
<When you see the quiet blue sea,>
<that will be me.>

1185
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:11,285
<Sachi...>

1186
01:52:13,295 --> 01:52:15,263
<Grow up quickly and healthy.>

1187
01:52:16,298 --> 01:52:20,530
<You brother will always look over you.>

1188
01:52:27,075 --> 01:52:28,406
<Father...>

1189
01:52:30,245 --> 01:52:32,907
<Your long face is distracting.>

1190
01:52:44,492 --> 01:52:45,720
<Mina-chan...>

1191
01:52:46,628 --> 01:52:50,894
<I'm now in my young golden age.>

1192
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:55,894
<I dedicate my youth to you.>

1193
01:52:57,873 --> 01:52:59,738
<Here is a request I have for you...>

1194
01:53:01,076 --> 01:53:06,514
<I would like you to see the things>
<I cannot see.>

1195
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:12,416
<Such as the beauty of today's sunset.>

1196
01:53:13,855 --> 01:53:18,189
<Such as the glittering of the summer sea.>

1197
01:53:19,227 --> 01:53:23,357
<Such as the redness of persimmon fruit>
<... that have changed color.>

1198
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:31,500
<Such as Nakano District Streets,>
<all covered with snow.>

1199
01:53:32,674 --> 01:53:35,208
<I want you to see those things instead of me.>

1200
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:41,810
<Then after a year...>

1201
01:53:43,018 --> 01:53:45,111
<I want you to forget about me.>

1202
01:53:46,688 --> 01:53:52,718
<I would like you to find a good husband
and have overflowing happiness.>

1203
01:53:54,629 --> 01:54:00,590
<I want you to live, and keep living...>

1204
01:54:02,337 --> 01:54:05,170
<until you tire of hearing it.>

<Japan's prof. postwar baseball team>

1208

1209
01:54:46,214 --> 01:54:48,705
So envious that Matsui and Ichiro can go.
