1
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,876
It's a real storm

2
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,081
Hey, take this

3
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,139
Yes

4
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,256
Who's in charge of the body-fat scale?

5
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,190
I think it's Shimada san

6
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,129
Right

7
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,678
We're here from Dalian, China

8
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,779
I'm Shao Yen

9
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,081
Nice to meet you

10
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,416
Your Japanese is good

11
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,986
We've been studying night and day

12
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,989
As soon as the telephone lines
to Dalian are installed,

13
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,191
you can hire 3 young locals

14
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,162
like her for what you pay one
Japanese employee here

15
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,263
I understand

16
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,060
That sounds good

17
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,540
Excuse me

18
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,349
We're going forward with the plan to move

19
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,518
the Administration Dept. to Dalian

20
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,052
I see

21
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:39,592
I'm aware of the great job you've done
as the director of Administration

22
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,228
So, Sasaki san,

23
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,322
what will you do after
you leave Administration?

24
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,733
What?

25
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,224
What are your skills?

26
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,138
You tell me

27
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,766
What can you contribute
to our Tanita Corporation?

28
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,142
It's entirely up to you

29
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,351
Either you contribute your fullest here

30
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,718
or you leave our company

31
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,362
About that air conditioning estimate

32
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,897
Oh, that
Yes

33
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,168
I think we should accept
Uchida System's bid

34
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,033
What do you think, Director?

35
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,178
Can I have that?

36
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:32,845
What?

37
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,614
That

38
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,876
Right

39
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,895
Did you visit Hello Work?

40
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,230
No

41
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,634
You've got to stop by Hello Work
before you come here

42
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,302
Oh, right

43
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,471
Go before your luck runs out

44
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,635
Otherwise, you'll be stuck here
for life, like me

45
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:02,466
Reception Closed for Today

46
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,410
Hey

47
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,345
It's open

48
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,124
You sure carry a lot around

49
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,790
It's too heavy

50
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,273
I'm home

51
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,230
Honey!

52
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,032
When did you get home?

53
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,867
Just now

54
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,236
Don't surprise me like that

55
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,971
Did you get off work early?

56
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:19,995
Yeah

57
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,313
What are you doing?

58
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,043
Just making sure all the doors are locked

59
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,943
I see

60
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,843
That's all

61
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,255
Anything wrong?

62
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,057
No

63
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,787
But you could use the front door

64
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,287
You're right

65
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,501
Thanks for the food

66
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,695
Sure

67
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,306
I'm off

68
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,206
Off you go

69
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,664
Will you be home early again today?

70
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,334
No, I've got a busy day

71
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,392
I see

72
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,103
Takashi?

73
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,671
Not yet

74
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,138
He's a mess

75
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,208
I'm off

76
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,539
Off you go

77
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,301
See ya

78
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,691
I'm home

79
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,749
Welcome home

80
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,095
Hungry?

81
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,323
No thanks

82
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,196
I'm going to bed Don't vacuum

83
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,711
So, on to the topic of mastering
honorific diction

84
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,982
Keigo diction is the skillful use
of 3 different types

85
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,553
of honorific speech in order to show
respect to the other person

86
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:52,458
We want you to use respectful language
to your elders,

87
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,394
so we'll investigate
the meaning of each...

88
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,658
Sasaki, what is that?

89
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,390
Show me

90
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,537
Ridiculous

91
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,577
I profoundly despise anyone
who would sneak this into my classroom

92
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,352
Stand

93
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,944
But...

94
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,112
You have no right to attend my class

95
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,158
Go stand in the back

96
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,793
That's not mine

97
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,695
Is that an excuse?

98
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:30,830
It's true

99
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,932
I was just passing it on

100
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,700
I told you to stand

101
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,463
In the back, hurry

102
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,037
Teacher

103
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,305
What?

104
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,968
I saw you reading porn manga
on the train the other day

105
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,313
I was sitting in front of you

106
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,016
You were trying hard to hide it,

107
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,918
but I could see the cover,
"Weekly Eros Mania"

108
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,522
Why do you say that?

109
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,547
Because it's true

110
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,956
He's got balls

111
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,991
This is hardly the place

112
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,235
You're right

113
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,793
It's not fair

114
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,835
Quiet!

115
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,896
Back to the lesson

116
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,779
So, honorific diction

117
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,382
Let's conjugate standard
diction into honorific

118
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,612
OK? Start with "To see"

119
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,287
Sasaki, you're amazing!

120
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,389
He looked so scared What a laugh

121
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,324
Let's call him Ero-Bayashi

122
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,092
Excellent

123
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,028
Ero-Bayashi! Ero-Bayashi!

124
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,624
Ero-Bayashi!

125
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,237
What?

126
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,243
I'm sorry about before

127
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,369
Right

128
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,513
I went too far

129
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,248
I didn't think the other kids

130
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,148
would react like that

131
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,319
You came to say that?

132
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,620
Yes

133
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,087
All this way?

134
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,688
Forget it

135
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,663
You'll graduate in less than a year

136
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,065
It's not going to change
how we get along

137
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,296
But that manga really isn't mine

138
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,808
So I didn't think it was fair
that I was the only one

139
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,673
who had to stand

140
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:30,416
Sasaki, let's stop poking at
each other's wounds

141
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,552
You can ignore me
and I'll ignore you, too

142
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,042
You got that?

143
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,213
Let's stop

144
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,650
More distinction between crescendo
and decrescendo, OK?

145
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,140
Again, from here

146
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,519
That's right, continue

147
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,994
A little stronger here

148
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,272
What was that other piece in C Major,

149
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,041
that you learned to play so well?

150
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,066
Let's see...

151
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,272
We're sorry to keep you waiting

152
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,375
Will the person holding ticket number 86

153
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,538
please proceed to window...

154
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,150
Your hours are midnight to 9
in the morning

155
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,085
Security guard at a factory

156
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,488
There's never been
a single robbery there

157
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,183
So you don't have to worry

158
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,031
Sasaki san,
how about administrative work?

159
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,566
I'm much more suited to that

160
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,296
Well,

161
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,439
maybe this is perfect for you

162
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,874
Please

163
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,967
A manager at a Happy Mart store,

164
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,378
Monday through Friday,

165
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,581
from 7 AM through 3PM 850 Yen an hour

166
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,384
I wrote it in the form I gave you,

167
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,321
but I used to be Administrative Director
at Tanita

168
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,491
It's not easy to say this,

169
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,257
but it's 100% impossible you'll match
your former position

170
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,001
We're sorry to keep you waiting

171
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,696
Here you go

172
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,566
Here's this month's salary

173
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,555
Thanks

174
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,946
I think it's time for a new stove

175
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,208
Yeah

176
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,381
I guess it can wait 'til your Bonus

177
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,364
Where's Takashi?

178
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,033
He left this afternoon
for one of his classes

179
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,668
I see

180
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,837
I hope he's not getting into trouble

181
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,031
Right

182
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,317
Your qualifying exams are coming up?

183
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,012
Yeah

184
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,318
Hang in there

185
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,252
Maybe I'll play piano

186
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,501
I want to play piano

187
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,729
It's OK, right?

188
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,506
No

189
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,174
Why not?

190
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,698
It's just a whim

191
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,943
Maybe you should
play in music class at school

192
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,749
No means no

193
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,713
Welcome home

194
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,941
I'm home

195
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,450
I've saved your meal

196
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,179
Yeah, I'll eat it

197
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,468
Look

198
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,366
What?

199
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,744
You got your driver's license

200
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,746
But you won't use it

201
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,146
It's just a form of identification

202
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,386
An expensive form of identification

203
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,887
Use your insurance card

204
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,445
I like this one better

205
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,094
It's rice porridge today

206
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,391
Hello

207
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,265
Hello

208
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,103
It's cold today, isn't it?

209
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,471
Sure is

210
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,962
Please wait a little longer

211
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,343
Hello, hello

212
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,445
Thanks for your patience

213
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,013
Here you are

214
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,549
Thanks for your patience

215
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,051
Sorry to keep you waiting

216
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,313
Here you are

217
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,606
Hey, Kurosu?

218
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,341
I thought it was you, Sasaki

219
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,070
Long time no see

220
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,379
You haven't changed since high school

221
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,074
Neither have you

222
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,043
Sorry

223
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,647
Hello

224
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:21,059
Sure, OK

225
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm meeting with a client right now

226
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,432
I'll talk to the Senior V.P. about
that myself

227
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,936
And don't worry about
the bid on the Municipal Hall

228
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,564
Sure, sure, thanks

229
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,874
You dropped this

230
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,309
Oh, thanks

231
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,436
You seem busy

232
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,547
You're in construction?

233
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,481
Something like that

234
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,852
What about you?

235
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,554
Healthcare equipment

236
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,681
Sounds great

237
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,396
Hey, what's that?

238
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,268
I think they're giving away food

239
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,606
You'd be surprised how many guys line up

240
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,578
Maybe I'll check it out

241
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,338
It's a rare chance to taste it

242
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,863
Are you by any chance, unemployed?

243
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,671
You can tell?

244
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,173
Yeah

245
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,470
Right

246
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,644
You are, too, right?

247
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,408
Yeah Got down-sized last week

248
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,782
I got downsized 3 months ago

249
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,923
What about that phone call?

250
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,413
That's just for show

251
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,962
I do it to calm my nerves

252
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,100
I know it's stupid

253
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,227
No, it was amazing

254
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,442
Aren't you going to eat that?

255
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,044
I already ate

256
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,306
Yeah...

257
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,249
It tastes lousy, right?

258
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,773
Yeah...

259
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,108
It's lousy

260
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,397
You can stay here as long as you want

261
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,471
Excuse me

262
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,837
I set up my phone
to ring 5 times an hour

263
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,372
I didn't know you could

264
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,974
It's not a very well-known feature,

265
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,210
so it fools most people

266
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,802
Oh, I see

267
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,716
Have you told your wife yet?

268
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,317
No

269
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,719
You hand her the monthly cash?

270
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,519
Yeah

271
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,689
That means you'll last for a while

272
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,191
Your severance pay?

273
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,625
Have they paid it all?

274
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,058
Not yet

275
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,864
Set up a separate bank account for it

276
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,533
Any irregular deposits will stand out

277
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,835
Unemployment insurance?

278
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,970
I'm just applying now

279
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,574
Make sure to submit
all the paperwork on time

280
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,735
One day late and you're disqualified

281
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,906
Oops

282
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,984
You're really amazing

283
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,817
Ero-Bayashi

284
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,467
Now, Kobayashi's totally lost
his authority over us

285
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,456
Yeah

286
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,372
This is like a revolution

287
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,007
A revolution!

288
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,542
Yeah

289
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,310
What's wrong?

290
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,335
You're the one that started it all

291
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,180
Kenji?

292
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,220
Welcome home

293
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,991
Kenji,

294
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,127
I'm making donuts
Why don't you come down?

295
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,389
I'm fine

296
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,665
Don't you want to eat donuts?

297
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,030
No thanks

298
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,664
Thanks for the food

299
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,483
Thanks

300
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,745
Hey Kenji

301
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,688
Your monthly lunch money
Put it in your bag

302
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,280
It's due tomorrow, right?

303
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,439
In China, a massive natural gas
development project...

304
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,100
Want a donut?

305
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:53,151
Let's examine China's current energy
sources breakdown

306
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,020
In fact, China is

307
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,756
the largest producer of coal
in the world,

308
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,824
and the world's
6th largest oil producer...

309
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,314
How about a donut?

310
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,163
In 1 990,

311
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,833
they depended on coal for 76% of
their energy,

312
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,736
and 17% on oil

313
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,772
But by 2002,

314
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:18,476
their coal dependency was reduced to 65%

315
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:24,278
and their oil dependency rose to 24% ...

316
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,744
You were having a nightmare

317
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:52,107
Kaneko Piano School

318
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,516
I'd like to pay for a month of lessons

319
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,947
Thank you

320
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,925
Did you come alone?

321
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:11,329
They said I'm in 6th grade now,
so I'm on my own

322
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,932
OK, we'll start next week

323
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,160
OK

324
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,345
Do you have a piano at home?

325
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,677
Yes, a small one

326
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,947
Come here

327
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,925
Can you play anything?

328
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,595
Try playing

329
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,442
Keep playing

330
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,259
I'm home

331
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,749
Welcome home

332
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,499
Takashi, you're home

333
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,734
That's rare

334
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,802
I don't have work today

335
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,070
Right

336
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,538
Do you want to shower first?

337
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,096
No, I'll eat now

338
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,709
Kenji, it's dinnertime

339
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,540
Come on down

340
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,780
Takashi, your book

341
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,268
I'll have a beer

342
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,792
I'll get it

343
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,596
Sure tasty

344
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,454
Let's eat

345
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,648
Let's eat

346
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,089
It's bad

347
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,235
I'm starting to
get home early these days

348
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,896
Yeah?

349
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,641
Think she knows?

350
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,809
What?

351
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,677
Has my wife figured it out?

352
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,413
Just because you get home
a little early? No

353
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,983
She stares at me
with eyes full of mistrust

354
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,713
I'm telling you, it's bad

355
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,991
I have to find a way to
make her trust me

356
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,262
Let me treat you to dinner

357
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,831
What do you want?

358
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,367
Please, come to my house

359
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,664
OK?

360
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:47,612
I'm home

361
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,170
Welcome

362
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,008
Hello

363
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,220
My daughter, Mika

364
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,620
Good evening

365
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,988
Good evening

366
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:57,789
Junior High?

367
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,057
I'm in 8th grade

368
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,491
You're so tall

369
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,103
Hey, didn't you order sushi?

370
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,644
But you said a home cooked meal was fine

371
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,135
I guess I did

372
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,574
It's a delicious meal

373
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:42,526
Oh, no, a job-related call at this hour

374
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:51,676
Do you put in overtime every day, too?

375
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,344
Well, yes

376
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,115
Is the company doing that well?

377
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,447
All of us employees are working hard

378
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,919
My husband won't tell me
anything about it

379
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:13,197
The company's doing fine
You don't need to worry

380
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,789
I see

381
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,369
Sasaki san,

382
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,268
please look after my husband

383
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,272
I will

384
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:40,992
That was our president,
calling about that estimate

385
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,859
You're the one that wrote it up,
right, Sasaki?

386
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,700
You need to be more diligent

387
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,403
I covered for you this time
as best I could

388
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,961
Get it together, OK?

389
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,803
I will

390
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,068
Please, use this

391
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,729
Oh, thank you

392
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,635
You have it rough, don't you?

393
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,600
The Tokyo National Museum was...

394
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,828
I'm home

395
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,741
The main building was

396
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,700
constructed in 1 938

397
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:46,609
It is a magnificent edifice,
exuding authority

398
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:53,420
Stepping inside, visitors are...

399
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,028
Welcome home

400
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,256
I'm home

401
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,467
Didn't you eat dinner?

402
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,729
No

403
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,636
I thought I'd make tempura

404
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,939
It's been a while

405
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,964
You'll eat, right?

406
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,770
No, I already ate

407
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,868
I see

408
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,344
My boss invited me out after the meeting

409
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,454
I'm really wiped

410
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,819
I'm going to bed

411
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,688
I'll go to bed, too

412
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,851
Pull me up

413
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,567
Somebody, please pull me up

414
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,619
Sasaki Ryuhei, please

415
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,643
Yes

416
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,391
You're 46 years old?

417
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,059
Yes

418
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,295
What can you do?

419
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,397
I'm willing to do anything

420
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,267
That's too vague

421
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,303
We want to know your specific skills

422
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,702
What?

423
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:18,876
We want you to show us what you excel at

424
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,311
Right here?

425
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,913
Yes, right now

426
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,111
Do you mean like singing Karaoke?

427
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:32,790
What skills can you contribute
to this company?

428
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,026
That's what we want to see

429
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,294
Not right here, now...

430
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:41,357
Then how are we expected to
judge your merits?

431
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,073
I've worked in administration

432
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,909
so I'm confident of
my interpersonal skills

433
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,377
I see, what else?

434
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,541
What else...

435
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,153
Did you really do nothing to prepare,

436
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,121
figuring you might just get lucky?

437
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,588
No

438
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,252
I understand

439
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,218
Your Karaoke is fine Please sing

440
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,166
Start singing What's wrong?

441
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,168
You're good at it, right?

442
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,308
Use that pen instead of
a microphone and sing

443
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,320
When you think about it,

444
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,153
we're like a slowly sinking ship

445
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:19,096
The lifeboats are long gone,

446
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:23,362
the water's up to our mouths

447
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,238
We know it's hopeless,

448
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,036
but we're still looking for an exit

449
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,379
But then, we don't have the courage to
dive underwater, either

450
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,548
Tell me, Kurosu, why is it?

451
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,417
I'm prepared to accept anything

452
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,181
But why aren't
they prepared to accept us?

453
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,988
The lifeboats are gone

454
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:56,067
They loaded them up with women,
children and young people

455
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,432
They're gone

456
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,850
It folds up like this,

457
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,986
making a perfect space for bicycles

458
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,422
Your whole family could go car camping

459
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,928
It's really great Get away with
just the family

460
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,125
That's exactly what this car
is perfect for

461
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,404
This car is all the rage now

462
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,272
But most people find it

463
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:40,869
more attractive as a second car,
than as the family car

464
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,342
Check out this handy feature

465
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,391
The roof goes away?

466
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:26,015
Please, please

467
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,995
Please

468
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,658
Please

469
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,328
I can't get rid of any

470
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,955
All gone

471
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,693
When's that giant earthquake coming?

472
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,769
The one that'll
turn everything upside down,

473
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,972
beat up all those arrogant bastards,

474
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,907
and make me Prime Minister,

475
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,899
so I can pass a No Helmet law

476
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,809
Yes, I understand

477
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,750
I'll notify my lawyer

478
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,687
Yes

479
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,958
Good bye, then

480
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,860
I won't contact you,

481
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,158
so please don't call me, either

482
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:13,964
OK

483
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,026
Good bye

484
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,688
I'm sorry

485
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,383
That's all for today's lesson

486
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,557
Thank you

487
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,412
Don't worry about me

488
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,746
But...

489
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,915
You're worried?

490
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,439
Sure, you are

491
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:12,156
I went and got a divorce

492
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:16,627
Our marriage was over,
so it doesn't really change anything

493
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,430
Once, he was a stranger, and now,

494
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,733
we're back to being strangers again

495
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,537
You're not going to see him again?

496
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,028
No, never again

497
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,437
That's what marriage is like

498
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,203
I understand

499
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,949
You do?

500
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,618
What do you understand?

501
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,485
How you feel

502
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,520
You do, huh?

503
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,963
Recently, I feel calmer being alone, too

504
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,601
When I'm with someone,
I end up saying the wrong thing

505
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,229
and we both get hurt

506
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,842
It's time for you to go home and study

507
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,070
See ya

508
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,887
Hey

509
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,081
What?

510
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,088
I need to ask you a favor

511
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,321
This is the Japanese version

512
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,780
You're signing up for
the American military?

513
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,981
Yeah

514
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,918
There's a new policy
You don't have to be an American

515
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,749
You saw it on TV, right?

516
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,778
It's news to me

517
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,093
I...

518
00:44:56,093 --> 00:45:00,064
Already passed the paper test

519
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:00,831
Wait a minute

520
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:05,996
I only have to pass the physical exam
and the thought exam and I'm in

521
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,640
If you're in the military,

522
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,542
you go to war, right?

523
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,305
It depends

524
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:18,743
But you should have consulted us before

525
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,456
Have you told your father?

526
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,684
No

527
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,451
I see

528
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,430
The thing is, I'm still a minor,

529
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,532
so I need a parent to sign

530
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,591
Here and here

531
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,565
C'mon, sign

532
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,479
If you won't, forget it

533
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:53,484
There are organizations that'll
sponsor me instead of parents

534
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:57,121
Don't ask some strange organization
to sign for you

535
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,952
Then, sign

536
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,790
Kurosu?

537
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:16,189
Kurosu san passed away With his wife

538
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,069
The other afternoon From gas poisoning

539
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,841
Really?

540
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,776
A double suicide,
but one forced the other

541
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,369
Welcome home

542
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,893
I'm home

543
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,495
Honey, listen to him
and try not to get mad

544
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,496
What is it?

545
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,693
I want you to sign these papers

546
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,805
I absolutely forbid it

547
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,006
Why?

548
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,443
I raised you so you could lead
a happy life

549
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,778
This couldn't be farther from that goal

550
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:44,281
But in the military,
you can work for peace

551
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,149
That's just rationalizing

552
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,686
But it's true
Why should I alone be happy?

553
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,722
It's better to
make the whole world happy

554
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,323
The whole world?

555
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,725
What's that?

556
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,393
Who cares about that?

557
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,090
I'm not worried about the world,
I'm worried about you

558
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,064
Huh

559
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,136
That's why Japan's so hopeless

560
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,704
What?

561
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,507
It's the American military
that protects Japan

562
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,475
So what?

563
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,780
Think about it, at least a little

564
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,517
The reason I want to join
the American military

565
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,652
is to protect you and Mom and Kenji

566
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,388
That's how it works

567
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,456
Don't be a smartass

568
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:29,126
In this house, I protect you
That's how it works

569
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,561
You can't just do whatever you want

570
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,860
You're the one that needs to
think about it

571
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,760
I don't want your protection

572
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,438
Get out, then

573
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,963
Get out!

574
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,068
Get out!

575
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,881
Forget it

576
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,782
I'll ask someone else

577
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,054
Takashi, wait!

578
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,834
Can't you figure out a better way
to talk to him!

579
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,869
Takashi, it's fine
if you want to leave us

580
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,239
But not for America

581
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,005
Stay in Japan and do what you can here,
OK?

582
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,375
What am I supposed to do?

583
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:32,211
You say you're protecting us, Dad

584
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,548
But what do you do, every day?

585
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,690
You can't even answer me

586
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,996
I have to get ready
