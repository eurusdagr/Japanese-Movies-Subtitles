1
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,322
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,004
Yamada, can you talk?

3
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:05,549
Yeah. What's the matter?

4
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,802
I don't feel well.

5
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:11,758
Really? A cold?

6
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,349
I think so.

7
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,516
I have a fever.

8
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:21,735
My head hurts, I can't even
go to a convenience store.

9
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,972
That's bad.

10
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:29,237
Yamada, I suppose...

11
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:36,121
You're still at work, can you buy
something for me on your way home?

12
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,516
I haven't eaten today.

13
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,580
Really? I'm at work now...

14
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,538
but I was just about to leave.

15
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:51,386
Well then, since you asked...

16
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,865
Yeah, less than an hour.

17
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:58,727
See you soon.

18
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,069
It's open.

19
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,285
Mamo, are you okay?

20
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,961
I'll make dinner.

21
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,302
Thank you.

22
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,143
Yamada, don't.

23
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,599
It's okay. This wasn't
sorted correctly.

24
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,520
Don't worry about me, just eat.

25
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,449
Listen...

26
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,557
What?

27
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,377
Can you leave now?

28
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:00,539
- Uh?
- Listen...

29
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:04,686
- Thanks for helping.
- It's fine, I can stay.

30
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,584
It's fine, really.

31
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:13,153
Wait, wait...

32
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,628
- Will you be fine?
- I'm going to sleep. Thanks, Yamada.

33
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:30,837
I just noticed... when did Mamo
stopped calling me by my first name?

34
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:45,260
[What is love?]

35
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,946
Uh?

36
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,111
What are you doing?!

37
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,283
Fine.

38
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:44,250
Just get on a taxi, I'm coming.

39
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,561
It'll be 2000 Yen to get here.

40
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:01,386
Not the Koshu Highway...
take the Inokashira exit.

41
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,786
Yeah.

42
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,048
Takaido, the apartment
complex on the left.

43
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:14,191
The left.

44
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,030
Okay... see you.

45
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,612
- Nakahara...
- Yes?

46
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,660
Go buy some beer.

47
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,682
Sure.

48
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,855
- Here.
- Oh, she sent you. Thank you.

49
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,039
Thank you.

50
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,320
- I bought beer.
- Thanks.

51
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:19,395
I'm going.

52
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,565
- Are you going home?
- Everyone alread left.

53
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,428
Ah, the door is
unlocked... don't knock.

54
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:29,424
Don't wake up her mom,
or you'll be in trouble.

55
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,893
See you.

56
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,314
Wait... why are you leaving?

57
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,939
Fool.

58
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,563
Guilty as charged.

59
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:03,633
- Nakahara left.
- I know.

60
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,212
So what?

61
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:09,197
I feel bad for him, it looks
like you kicked him out.

62
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,368
- Whatever, it's fine.
- But...

63
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,563
Are you hungry?

64
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,027
Yes!

65
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:25,989
I made Udon for Mamo,
but I didn't eat.

66
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:30,225
- There's some Chikuzenni my mom made.
- Yes please!

67
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,500
"I got a cold, come here and
make me dinner"?! Is he for real?

68
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:48,172
And he throws out a girl in the middle
of the night. He's got some nerve.

69
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:51,056
That's not what happened, Yoko.

70
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,476
He never asked me
to make him dinner.

71
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,813
He only asked me to
buy something for him.

72
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:01,324
He had a fever of
almost 40 Â°C.

73
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:03,047
I couldn't just leave.

74
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:08,009
Listen, if you always act subservient,
the relationship roles are settled.

75
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,470
He'll keep taking
advantage of you.

76
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,325
Here.

77
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,499
And stop wasting your
time on that Little Lord.

78
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,523
I'm diving in.

79
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:47,891
Woah, this is delicious!

80
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,764
Do you want some? The leftovers?

81
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,411
No need to share,
you'll miss out.

82
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,103
Hey.

83
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,986
- Yes?
- Finish eating and let's go to bed.

84
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,672
Okay.

85
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,759
[to: Tanaka Mamoru]

86
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:41,346
[good night]
[take care of yourself]

87
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,048
What's the point?

88
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:04,397
I'm not Mamo's girlfriend.

89
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,318
- See you!
- Bye bye.

90
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,472
Friend of the bride?

91
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,669
- More or less.
- More or less?

92
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,950
How do you know her?

93
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:34,587
She's the friend of a friend...
we ate dinner once together.

94
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,471
Same.

95
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:50,527
The concept of friendship
is a fuzzy one, isn't it.

96
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,654
Indeed.

97
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,529
That's how I meet Tanaka Mamoru.

98
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,584
Nothing special.

99
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,569
Two people chatting at an
mutual acquaintance's party.

100
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,084
- Here.
- Thanks.

101
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,212
I'm Tanaka Mamoru.

102
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,923
Yamada Teruko.

103
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,060
I'll call you Teru.

104
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,166
So... you'll be Mamo.

105
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:29,482
- Oh, sorry. Cheers.
- Cheers.

106
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:37,257
"Beautiful hands",
I thought that time.

107
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:44,247
Yes, please fill that in.
If you send it back to us...

108
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:48,749
we'll send you a gift.

109
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:57,927
On Fridays, there's a 90% chance
that Mamo will message me.

110
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:03,609
It has been 5 months, and at this point
think I understand him quite well.

111
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,359
Yamada.

112
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,606
Yamada!

113
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:12,037
- Yes?
- Do you have a minute?

114
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:22,202
You keep missing deadlines
and making mistakes.

115
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,970
You weren't like this before.

116
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,252
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,542
Please be more careful.

118
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:33,841
Got it.

119
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,747
Good job today.

120
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,608
See you.

121
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,128
- See you.
- Take care.

122
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:35,066
I got used to kill
time at the office...

123
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:38,769
so I could answer immediately
whenever he called me.

124
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:06,172
Well, it's normal to
be wrong sometimes.

125
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,024
Let's eat.

126
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,686
Hello?

127
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,130
Dinner?

128
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,176
I haven't eaten yet.
I had overtime today.

129
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,611
I'm on my way home,
and super hungry.

130
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,198
Uh? Sure!

131
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,030
Yeah it's fine.

132
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:10,679
I'll write when I'm there.

133
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,039
Bye.

134
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:25,499
- Thanks for helping me that day.
- It's nothing. Did you sleep?

135
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:26,591
Yeah.

136
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:29,508
Take something you
like, it's on me.

137
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,993
- Really?
- Yeah. Grilled crab, or blowfish.

138
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,767
The blowfish though.

139
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,983
Do you think it's real?

140
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,325
- Heard you're busy at work.
- It's the end of the month.

141
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:45,780
- Today wasn't bad, though.
- That's great.

142
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:53,315
To be honest, magazines layout...
it's always the same stuff.

143
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:58,000
You could do a quick job
and go home for the weekend.

144
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:01,753
But it's my job, so
I want to do it well.

145
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,147
That's right.

146
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,538
In this field, you
never stop to learn.

147
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:15,268
But you look like someone
that has good eye.

148
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:18,596
I still wish I could
do even better.

149
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,737
When I'm 33 I'll quit and
become a pro baseball player.

150
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,268
You said you wanted to
be a shrine carpenter!

151
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,361
Shrine carpenter?

152
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,042
- Did I say that?
- Yes!

153
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,219
Shrine! It's even harder
than normal carpenter!

154
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:41,607
- Pro baseball is hard, too!
- Everyone knows that!

155
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,466
Let this child dream.

156
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,825
Here's my dream: a 33
years old debutant!

157
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:49,894
From publishing. An
incredibile career change!

158
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:51,541
That's silly.

159
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,444
- Have you choosen?
- Yeah.

160
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,091
So...

161
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:59,704
Mackerel, fried eggplant...

162
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,353
and a bottle of shochu.

163
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:04,167
Not a bottle!

164
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:06,400
But you said anything I liked!

165
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:09,498
If you get drunk you
won't be able to go home.

166
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,698
- Excuse me!
- Coming!

167
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:17,537
Mackerel.

168
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,313
- And grilled eggplant.
- Fried.

169
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,160
Beer for me, and a
glass of shochu, right?

170
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,689
- A glass then.
- Okay.

171
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:39,634
I don't get why
people like Yuba.

172
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:43,497
It's like the membrane
you get on hot milk.

173
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,650
Yeah.

174
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:51,248
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

175
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,953
You made me stay
out until morning.

176
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,221
What? You called me!

177
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,542
- Why did you come?
- Uh?!

178
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:10,615
- It's cold.
- Yeah...

179
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,555
No taxis.

180
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:21,141
None.

181
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:24,911
Should we go on the main street?

182
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,071
Oh, here's one!

183
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:51,619
- Yamada, let's go home.
- Uh?

184
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,052
- To Setagaya, please.
- Okay.

185
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,086
Good morning.

186
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,104
Good morning.

187
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:26,836
What are we eating?

188
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,334
For lunch.

189
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,154
Do you have plans
for the afternoon?

190
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,211
Why?

191
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,715
Let's go somewhere.

192
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,538
Hot?

193
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:11,856
Ah! It's hot!

194
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,091
Tasty?

195
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:17,655
When you're in love
in your late 20s...

196
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:21,782
"I like you, let's date"
is not said with words.

197
00:22:24,088 --> 00:22:28,622
It starts like this, drop
by drop, not all at once.

198
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,847
Don't!

199
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:49,518
After that day, Mamo started
calling me almost everyday.

200
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:54,566
And when he calls,
I always say yes.

201
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:03,216
If I miss the last
train, I'll just stay.

202
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,632
Ugh.

203
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,885
- Mamo!
- Uh?

204
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,683
- What time?
- It's 10:30.

205
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,048
Don't you have to
work this afternoon?

206
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,020
- I have to go, too.
- Hey...

207
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,988
Let's go to the zoo.

208
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:01,465
- What about work?
- Deadline is tomorrow, I have time.

209
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,374
Let's shower together.

210
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,537
- Like this? Feels good?
- Yeah.

211
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:35,332
- It's perfect.
- It is?

212
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,255
Feels good.

213
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:02,109
- I may quit my job.
- Why?

214
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,194
I think...

215
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,666
It's not a good fit.

216
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,174
I see.

217
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:14,572
You'll be fine.

218
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,876
Freedom!

219
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:21,078
Freedom?

220
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,943
You can enjoy your
unemployment insurance.

221
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:39,045
At 33 I'll quit
to be a zookeeper.

222
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,835
More realistic that pro
baseball player, right?

223
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,360
What's the matter?

224
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:18,905
Why are you crying?!

225
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,648
- Dunno.
- That's crazy.

226
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:31,321
- Uh?
- What?

227
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:33,763
That's rude.

228
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:44,602
Mamo says he wants to quit
at 33 to be a zookeeper...

229
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:48,799
but what I wonder is if
I'll be part of that future.

230
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,342
At the time, I
really believed...

231
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:54,555
we were going to have a
great future together.

232
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,513
That's why I was crying.

233
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,456
But if I had said that, Mamo
would have laughed even more.

234
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:03,397
"I don't get it",
he would've said.

235
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:20,956
You know, I don't think I had
any expectation for my life.

236
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,797
But God, instead of
letting me dying early...

237
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:29,374
actually granted
my greatest wish!

238
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,590
Listen, God's will is not
something we can understand...

239
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,303
so stop with this nonsense.

240
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,083
Isn't that guy pretty hot?

241
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:50,402
You think so?

242
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:55,324
You don't? Someone strong,
that can protect you.

243
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,457
Is that so?

244
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:03,082
I've always liked slender guys,
slim but elegant, like a cat...

245
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:05,242
I think they're cuter.

246
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,504
Always? You're making that up.

247
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:13,322
Yoko, how do you
think we fall in love?

248
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,659
We say "my type is"...

249
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:19,482
but we're just looking back
at the people we've loved...

250
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,938
and grouping them into
made-up categories.

251
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:26,895
Falling in love is something that
happens in an instant, you just feel it.

252
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:29,391
It has nothing to
do with reason.

253
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:33,885
You're daydreaming. Be careful
at work, or you'll be fired.

254
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:37,520
Well... I was.

255
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:40,205
What? They fired you?!

256
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,345
- Yeah.
- Uh?

257
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:45,082
What are you gonna do?

258
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,179
You know, Yoko...

259
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,923
I think luck in love is inversely
proportional to luck in your job.

260
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:56,045
I don't want my love
fortune to decrease...

261
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,357
so I won't look for a new job.

262
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:01,819
You say some really
dumb things sometimes.

263
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,971
I'd rather think
about marriage...

264
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,879
than looking for a job.

265
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,190
Wait, did you tell him?

266
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:14,403
I haven't, but I did tell him
I was thinking about resigning.

267
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:17,261
"You'll be fine" he said.

268
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:19,205
"That's freedom"

269
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,038
Freedom?

270
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:24,555
Wait, are you dating?

271
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,493
Perhaps.

272
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:31,984
Perhaps?

273
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:05,954
Yamada!

274
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,458
You can throw that away.

275
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I'm having lunch.

276
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,130
Thanks.

277
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,041
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

278
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:45,786
I used to come here
during my lunch break.

279
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:48,837
You did?

280
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,355
It's so silly.

281
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,286
Uh?

282
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:04,263
Nowadays, to be
fired for a man...

283
00:31:05,806 --> 00:31:07,806
is very unusual.

284
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,936
I guess it is.

285
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:20,153
Honestly, I'm jealous.

286
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,133
Why?

287
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,782
Looking at you...

288
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:32,332
I realized I've never met
a person I truly loved.

289
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,009
I suppose it's not uncommon.

290
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,090
To never meet someone
you really really love.

291
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,193
You think so?

292
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:46,763
But yeah...

293
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,265
It's probably the reason our
society is still functional.

294
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:54,521
Woah, that's mean!

295
00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:01,987
To be honest, I don't live just
to make the society function.

296
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,533
See, you're silly.

297
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:13,040
My mind has exactly two modes.

298
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:16,793
"In love" and "whatever".

299
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:21,006
So I don't care much
about anything...

300
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,510
except the person
I'm in love with.

301
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,639
What about yourself?

302
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,448
I'm getting married next month.

303
00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:51,078
But I'll keep working.

304
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:59,669
Marriage is not
forever, nowadays.

305
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,621
I guess.

306
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,528
Donabe, stewpot...

307
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:27,053
for 2 people.

308
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,700
Ugh.

309
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:05,045
Marriage, uh?

310
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,816
Should have bought more beer.

311
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:35,182
- I'll go.
- It's fine, I wasn't asking.

312
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:39,382
Don't you want to have
a drink? I do. I'll go.

313
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,976
What are you doing?

314
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:44,858
It's 2 am, just
take a bath already.

315
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,691
Don't worry. How many
bottles? One? Two?

316
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,718
Same brand?

317
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:02,174
You can say anything to me.

318
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:07,130
Ask me to do this and
that... anything you need.

319
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:13,094
You don't have to hesitate, or
be polite, when you're with me.

320
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,745
I'm going.

321
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:50,084
Mamo what's the
matter? It's only 7am.

322
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,543
I have to leave,
I've got a meeting.

323
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,429
And we're leaving together.

324
00:35:57,862 --> 00:36:01,583
What? If we leave now,
you'll be there at 8am.

325
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,446
Don't you start at 10?

326
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:06,606
Not today, I've got
a packed schedule.

327
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:11,528
You didn't mention
this meeting yesterday.

328
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,766
- Why didn't you tell me yesterday?
- Here, coffee.

329
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,697
Can I sleep a little bit more?

330
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,890
I'll lock the door when I leave.

331
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,633
I don't want people here
when I'm away, you know that.

332
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:30,626
The other day I cleaned and did the
laundry and you didn't say anything!

333
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,566
Fine, let's talk about my day.

334
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,239
You want to know about my meeting?

335
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:44,603
My magazine isn't doing well,
apparently it has too many words.

336
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:46,938
They want more images.

337
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:51,118
Casual stuff, like articles
about gourmet restaurants.

338
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:55,405
Get a young photographer, doing
street photography, and so on.

339
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:58,381
So we've been fighting.

340
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:01,860
It's not clear what's
the best way forward...

341
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:06,958
Each one of us was told to
come up with 5 new ideas.

342
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:55,131
After that day, Mamo
stopped calling me.

343
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,407
It looked like I wasn't going to
be part of his future, after all.

344
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,157
Since even just one month
after that day at the zoo...

345
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:07,293
I already wasn't part of it.

346
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,744
Teru, I'm leaving.

347
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,471
Wait, what?

348
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,269
You asked me to spend
New Year's Eve together!

349
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,197
That's why I'm here.

350
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:34,354
That was my plan.

351
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:38,258
But I was invited to a coworker's
party, it was so sudden.

352
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Sudden? What does that mean?!

353
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:42,145
And Nakahara?

354
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:45,932
What about Nakahara?
He did come for you.

355
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,643
- He's inside.
- Is he?!

356
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,868
He's not coming with you?

357
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:53,261
He's staying here,
he'll be fine.

358
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,817
And he's not alone,
my mom is there.

359
00:38:56,307 --> 00:38:58,945
And you can stay, too!

360
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:03,873
Well, it's time for
me go to. See you.

361
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,004
Wait! Are you really leaving?!

362
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,007
Hello there.

363
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,833
I'm very sorry.

364
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,025
You took the trouble to come.

365
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:26,527
Here, for you.

366
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:31,406
You shouldn't have!

367
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:34,314
Thank you very much.

368
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,583
"Top-grade sake".

369
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:41,112
- Should we open it?
- Yeah!

370
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:45,101
Let's open it!

371
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,881
That Yoko.

372
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,797
If only she was as
nice as you two...

373
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,425
my life would've been easier.

374
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:04,194
That's right.

375
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,123
People like her live a
peaceful life, though.

376
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,607
Not at all.

377
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:12,477
That kind of the
personality is the worst.

378
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:26,538
When she was in kindergarten....

379
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,596
we went to a department
store to buy a dress.

380
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:34,485
They had this cute
polka-dot dress.

381
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:39,379
I said: "You wanted a
dress like that, right?"

382
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:41,629
"I don't!" she said.

383
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,033
She started to cry.

384
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:51,079
She was disappointed that
I could see through her.

385
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:58,648
We ended up going home
without buying anything.

386
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,812
Sounds like something
Yoko would do.

387
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,194
See?

388
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,114
You know...

389
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:13,421
I wanted her to be a child
who can express her desires.

390
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,897
Well, she grew up
looking at me, after all.

391
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:42,253
- Delicious, thanks for this.
- You're welcome.

392
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,129
And cheers to Yoko, too.

393
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,852
Even if she's so selfish...

394
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,762
she has friends like you.

395
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,879
Please keep looking after her.

396
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:07,091
Well... goodnight.

397
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:18,893
Happy New Year.

398
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,560
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

399
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,145
Why Gyoza, though?

400
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:47,757
It's chinese food, after all.

401
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,239
So what?

402
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:52,011
I dunno, ask Yoko.

403
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:54,512
Whatever.

404
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:09,056
Teruko...

405
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:16,341
Do you ever start feeling
lonely all of a sudden?

406
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:22,035
Sometimes, when I'm
drinking alone at home...

407
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:25,795
I suddenly realize
I feel lonely.

408
00:43:26,946 --> 00:43:28,795
Oh... yeah.

409
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:32,719
And you'd like to make
small talk with someone.

410
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:37,843
Like "there's nothing on TV",
or "I saw a puppy today".

411
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,578
Yeah, like that.

412
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:42,395
You know...

413
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:49,053
I want to be the person Yoko can
call anytime she feels like that.

414
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:54,249
Honestly it would be fine
even if it's not always me.

415
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:55,948
Like...

416
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:59,495
just when no one
else is available.

417
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:02,832
"Oh, right, there's Nakahara!"

418
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,958
Even that would be fine.

419
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:11,966
Nakahara... that's pathetic.

420
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:14,218
You think so?

421
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:16,471
Really?

422
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:22,685
As for me... I'd like
to become one with Mamo.

423
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:27,577
I'd like to be one with him.

424
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:32,653
If that's not possible, his
mother... or his sister.

425
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:34,989
Or just a cousin!

426
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,119
Teruko, this is pathetic, too.

427
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:45,041
We sound like we're in a
meeting of the stalkers league.

428
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:48,119
What are you talking about?!

429
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,766
- Soon.
- Yeah.

430
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:13,826
I just want to be happy.

431
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,656
Uh?

432
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,430
I just want to be happy.

433
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,098
Yeah...

434
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,284
Spring came, and Mamo
still hadn't contacted me.

435
00:46:02,912 --> 00:46:06,005
You have experience in
a reception position...

436
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:07,609
that's great.

437
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:10,396
I did some part-time
in high school.

438
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:11,752
Great.

439
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:16,549
We get a lot of new customers this
time of the year, so be polite.

440
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:17,906
Got it.

441
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:21,053
- Can you do weekends and holidays?
- I can.

442
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,927
I used to come here to climb.

443
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,247
Sorry.

444
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:28,682
[Mamoru]

445
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,634
Sorry, I have to go.

446
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,477
- What?
- I'm sorry!

447
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,570
Wait a minute!

448
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,775
Hello?

449
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:45,370
I'm a little busy, why?

450
00:46:56,444 --> 00:46:58,049
This is Teruko Yamada.

451
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,164
This is Sumire Tsukakoshi.

452
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,798
- Good evening.
- Nice to meet you.

453
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:15,013
Sumire is a cool name.

454
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:17,161
You think so? Thanks.

455
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:21,989
What do you do?

456
00:47:22,513 --> 00:47:24,994
Administration in
an arts cram school.

457
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:26,744
Arts cram school?

458
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:32,170
So... how did you meet?

459
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:37,380
It was... end of last year?

460
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,649
- November?
- Yeah.

461
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:43,322
A mixer party. At
our age! Laughable.

462
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:47,765
Maribu... oh, Maribu is a
former pupil of my cram school.

463
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:51,045
He said "we don't have
enough people", so I went.

464
00:47:52,342 --> 00:47:58,888
I was brough there by an intern,
everyone was like 20 years old.

465
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:04,910
That was mean. I'm 34. Well,
35 at the end of this month.

466
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:09,495
I was the oldest! Thank
god Tanaka was there.

467
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,922
Thank you for waiting.

468
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,495
Red tai carpaccio, and
the cheese selection.

469
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,383
Looks delicious! Let's eat!

470
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:31,861
Try this Red Tai. To die for!

471
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:38,691
- Incredible!
- Sublime!

472
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:41,736
Delicious.

473
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:47,999
- Wah, this Yuba is incredible!
- Really?!

474
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,958
So Teru, what do you do?

475
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:01,213
I'm not working right
now, isn't that great.

476
00:49:01,324 --> 00:49:04,592
Really? That's cool.

477
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,789
Try some.

478
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:13,521
It's to die for!

479
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,575
Is it, uh?

480
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:20,608
- To die for!
- To die for!

481
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:24,862
- Isn't it?
- It is...

482
00:49:31,424 --> 00:49:35,664
Oh, right... I'm
meeting a friend.

483
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:37,879
See you.

484
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:40,461
See you again, Teru.

485
00:49:40,983 --> 00:49:42,328
Take care.

486
00:49:55,457 --> 00:49:57,457
I'm going, then.

487
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:04,151
Why did you ask me to come?

488
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:07,744
No reason, it has
been a while.

489
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:10,929
I just wanted to have
a drink together.

490
00:50:11,262 --> 00:50:12,672
Did it bother you?

491
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:15,215
It didn't.

492
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:23,013
She's your girlfriend?

493
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:28,901
It looks like you were
introducing me to your partner.

494
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:34,618
You've got a lover,
so why call me?

495
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:36,142
It's not like that.

496
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,772
You know...

497
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:47,751
You were acting weird.

498
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,317
No, don't say that.

499
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:54,160
Like a few weeks ago...

500
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,452
It was a little strange.

501
00:50:57,342 --> 00:51:00,499
- Maybe I was too sensitive.
- Sorry, but...

502
00:51:05,057 --> 00:51:06,804
I'm learning from Sumire.

503
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:09,842
As you saw she's not refined...

504
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:12,192
I feel comfortable around her.

505
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:26,702
See you.

506
00:51:45,273 --> 00:51:47,273
Tsukakoshi Sumire...

507
00:51:53,128 --> 00:51:55,128
Who's that?

508
00:51:57,106 --> 00:51:59,106
Tsukakoshi Sumire.

509
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:04,926
Shabby underwear...

510
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:08,197
<i>(Rapping)
Bad intestines...</i>

511
00:52:09,357 --> 00:52:11,697
<i>Constipated all the time...</i>

512
00:52:12,814 --> 00:52:14,814
<i>Smoking too much...</i>

513
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:19,720
<i>Black lungs, bad liver...</i>

514
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,457
<i>Dry back, always
feeling itchy...</i>

515
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:27,191
<i>but she can't scratch
because she's all stiff.</i>

516
00:52:27,432 --> 00:52:30,339
<i>Even the pupils at her school...</i>

517
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:33,384
<i>spread weird rumors about her.</i>

518
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:36,512
<i>Having an affair with her boss.</i>

519
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:38,971
<i>And yet, I'm relieved.</i>

520
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:42,547
<i>She buys plants, but
they die right away.</i>

521
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:45,854
<i>Her balcony the
wreckage of a garden.</i>

522
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:52,695
<i>Cockroaches eggs from last
winter, hatching in her house!</i>

523
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:55,524
<i>Itchy back!</i>

524
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:58,547
<i>Serves you right!</i>

525
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,675
You know...

526
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:18,879
you were acting pretty weird.

527
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:22,558
Serves you right!

528
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,899
Teru!

529
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,779
Teruko!

530
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,937
Teru!

531
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,398
Coming!

532
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:16,528
It makes me so angry. Pathetic.

533
00:54:19,238 --> 00:54:24,572
The way he acts... he reminds me
of my father, it's so irritating.

534
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,997
Your father?

535
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:31,335
You know, my mom...

536
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:36,003
was what in the old times
you'd have called a mistress.

537
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:38,467
- Really?
- Yeah.

538
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:42,237
So my father...

539
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:46,016
was more like an old man
who visits once in a while.

540
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:51,443
Once he showed my mom a picture
of his child at school sports day.

541
00:54:51,814 --> 00:54:53,928
I wished he'd die.

542
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,819
- That much?
- Yeah.

543
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,405
And he looked down
on her, you know?

544
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:02,574
I can't look down on him?

545
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:08,955
My mom is the kind of woman who's
good for a man that is never home.

546
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,482
She always had a cold beer for him
in the fridge. Isn't that great?

547
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:21,152
Tasty?

548
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:25,857
A great thing about you...

549
00:55:26,107 --> 00:55:29,864
is how diligently you starve
yourself when you're sad.

550
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:33,125
But please tell me when
you're planning to die.

551
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:35,703
I won't be able to
see Mamo if I die.

552
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:41,617
You're not even weird...
just plain creepy.

553
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:48,237
Anyway, to keep your
mind and body healthy...

554
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:51,456
you have to eat well, and work.

555
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,743
Let's see...
Teruko, you're next!

556
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:11,310
My dream is to be a
kindergarten teacher.

557
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:15,147
I love children, and
I'll be a great teacher.

558
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:21,514
Actually, you should get a
job with a lot of free time...

559
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,584
so you can spend it with Mamo.

560
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,325
Kindergarten teacher?
That's ridiculous!

561
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:53,560
- Come on!
- Yes.

562
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:41,817
Do you want one? I made it.

563
00:58:35,693 --> 00:58:37,398
Hello?

564
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,335
Sumire?

565
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:44,461
What's the matter?

566
00:59:10,754 --> 00:59:14,273
- Teru, here!
- Hello.

567
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,250
Good evening, Teru.

568
00:59:27,182 --> 00:59:30,729
- So where do you come from?
- I'm from Tokyo.

569
00:59:33,222 --> 00:59:35,222
Then I moved to Singapore.

570
00:59:39,736 --> 00:59:42,804
- Where's Mamo?
- Takaka? I didn't call him.

571
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:44,773
You didn't?

572
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:05,110
Hello? Sorry for calling
you all of a sudden.

573
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:09,436
You're at work? Sorry.

574
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:17,590
It's not urgent, just...
I'm with Sumire right now.

575
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:25,616
Mamo!

576
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,169
Tanaka, why are you here?

577
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:31,695
Yamada called me.

578
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:36,821
Sumire, you told me to
invite Tanaka, right?

579
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,137
- Uh?
- Mamo, have a drink.

580
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:47,551
- Sit there?
- Sure.

581
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,684
- A new one.
- Uh?

582
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,682
- Ashtray.
- Ah, sure.

583
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,175
A White and a Red, please.

584
01:01:48,877 --> 01:01:50,982
- Here!
- Put it there.

585
01:01:53,629 --> 01:01:57,612
By the way, didn't you say
you had a holiday house?

586
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:58,910
Really?

587
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:01,301
We were talking
about a barbeque.

588
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:04,156
But not in the city, it's sad.

589
01:02:04,218 --> 01:02:06,218
Like in the middle of Nature.

590
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,980
A place for summer trips?

591
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:14,594
It's not mine, a friend's
parents own it... near a lake.

592
01:02:14,627 --> 01:02:16,988
We can use it if
we plan in advance.

593
01:02:17,027 --> 01:02:20,175
Great! Let's go there then!

594
01:02:20,242 --> 01:02:22,242
In Tanaka's holiday house!

595
01:02:26,918 --> 01:02:30,065
No, no, it's not mine,
my friend's parents...

596
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:31,938
But you can borrow, right?

597
01:02:32,078 --> 01:02:35,000
Next week! End of the month.

598
01:02:35,025 --> 01:02:37,892
Uh... I'll ask my friend.

599
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:43,160
Teru, you're coming too, right?

600
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,513
I don't think...

601
01:02:46,732 --> 01:02:49,249
If you don't come,
I won't either.

602
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:53,170
Yamada, please come! I'm
inviting my friends too.

603
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:58,925
- Okay, then.
- Huzzah!

604
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,422
It'll be super fun!
Let's bring fireworks!

605
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:57,772
I'm going home.

606
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:26,638
I'm sorry.

607
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:29,683
For what?

608
01:04:30,037 --> 01:04:34,938
Nothing... forget it.

609
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:41,467
You liar.

610
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:45,615
I'm not a liar.

611
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:48,918
But sorry anyway.

612
01:04:51,413 --> 01:04:53,264
It's fine either way.

613
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:04,175
- Yamada...
- What?

614
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:09,951
Are you going anywhere?

615
01:05:42,031 --> 01:05:45,304
No beer... I'm buying some.

616
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:48,036
- No need.
- It's close.

617
01:05:48,053 --> 01:05:50,053
- It's fine.
- But...

618
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:55,727
Yamada...

619
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,939
What?

620
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:04,402
Let's do it.

621
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:08,068
Give me a second.

622
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:14,055
You drank too much.

623
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:20,408
It's okay, let's stop.

624
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,184
Why though.

625
01:07:40,248 --> 01:07:42,000
Whatever.

626
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:46,400
- You don't like me, uh?
- It's not that, come on.

627
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:48,994
That was a joke.

628
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:05,940
I've never been to
Nakameguro before.

629
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:09,068
Me neither.

630
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,987
I wouldn't go there
unless I had a reason to.

631
01:08:14,114 --> 01:08:18,437
Actually, I never go anywhere
unless I have a reason to.

632
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:28,679
That relationship
was at a dead end.

633
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:34,833
- With Sumire?
- Yeah.

634
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:37,759
You know what I mean?

635
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,104
Not really.

636
01:08:48,784 --> 01:08:51,617
I thought you were
that kind of man.

637
01:08:52,013 --> 01:08:53,327
Uh?

638
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,783
Nothing.

639
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:08,169
I...

640
01:09:12,194 --> 01:09:14,194
I'm not that cool.

641
01:09:16,383 --> 01:09:19,750
Outstanding, fashionable,
or anything like that.

642
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:22,664
and I'm too thin.

643
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,851
Thin? What does that even mean?

644
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:32,819
I don't come across
as a kind person.

645
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:38,155
I'm not rich, and I can do my
job... but it's not that hard.

646
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:49,961
I don't think I'm the worst...

647
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:56,617
But if you divide society in
two: cool people, and not cool...

648
01:09:57,781 --> 01:10:00,378
I would be in the
"not cool" group.

649
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:02,893
I guess.

650
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:06,060
Right?

651
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:10,565
Yeah.

652
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,336
That kind of man.

653
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:18,623
So why are you so nice to me?

654
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:23,468
- Nice?
- Yeah.

655
01:10:24,871 --> 01:10:26,789
Like this evening.

656
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:31,270
You invited me to the
place where Sumire was.

657
01:10:34,276 --> 01:10:36,276
That was just...

658
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:42,013
Well, you like her.
That's the reason.

659
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:50,021
I don't think I did fall
for her, I just said I did.

660
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,541
Is that so.

661
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,175
I thought so.

662
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:04,765
You weren't in love, you
just pretended to be.

663
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:08,039
Weird.

664
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:11,501
What's that.

665
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,545
I...

666
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,521
I'm being honest with
you, don't insult me.

667
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:21,594
Hear me?

668
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:31,078
- It hurts.
- Does it?

669
01:11:31,847 --> 01:11:34,399
- It doesn't.
- Not funny.

670
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:06,097
What?

671
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:12,520
What's this?

672
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:16,107
Why are you hard now?!

673
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,592
I guess the Sake is gone.

674
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:29,412
- You're attractive, after all.
- After all?!

675
01:12:45,045 --> 01:12:48,181
I knew you didn't
actually like her.

676
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,498
Someone like her? That's absurd.

677
01:12:56,756 --> 01:13:00,183
- You think so?
- Yeah.

678
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,893
Since I'm enough for you, right?

679
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:10,328
Not Sumire... me.

680
01:13:18,197 --> 01:13:19,743
Are you?

681
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,527
- What will you do?
- Mh?

682
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:47,949
What will you do?

683
01:13:57,522 --> 01:13:59,094
Dunno.

684
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:10,471
Put her behind.

685
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,778
I will never forgive them.

686
01:15:11,991 --> 01:15:15,536
Let's have fun anyway!
I'll prepare the meat.

687
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:17,371
Me too.

688
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,929
Nakahara, the charcoal.

689
01:15:31,756 --> 01:15:34,555
Mamo rented an 8-seater...

690
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,183
but not everyone came.

691
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:42,788
Nakame's friend said "Was
it today? Sorry, I'm busy".

692
01:15:42,828 --> 01:15:44,989
And he dodged Sumire.

693
01:15:47,558 --> 01:15:51,238
Mamo just took the house
keys from his friend...

694
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:53,950
and didn't invite anyone else.

695
01:15:55,965 --> 01:15:59,170
I think he wanted to
be alone with Sumire.

696
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:05,263
As for me, I wanted
to enjoy myself...

697
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:08,965
and I was in a summer trip mood.

698
01:16:11,353 --> 01:16:15,373
And when I went to Yoko's
house to invite her...

699
01:16:15,423 --> 01:16:20,461
Why should we get involved in his
attempt to woo a 30 y.o. woman?!

700
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:22,643
It'll be super fun, come on.

701
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:25,107
Nakahara, what about you?

702
01:16:26,204 --> 01:16:28,862
Teru can't go there
by herself, right?

703
01:16:29,904 --> 01:16:31,218
Are you coming?

704
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:35,366
- I'd prefer not to.
- Just go!

705
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:38,007
I don't want to.

706
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:46,899
I'm going.

707
01:16:46,927 --> 01:16:49,489
So Nakahara was forced to come.

708
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:52,525
Just 4 people.

709
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,748
Done!

710
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:14,839
- So you're a photographer?
- Assistant, actually.

711
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,827
- So you have a lot of cameras?
- I guess so...

712
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:22,348
Not that many.

713
01:17:22,462 --> 01:17:24,915
- How many?
- Like three.

714
01:17:26,918 --> 01:17:28,586
How many?!

715
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:32,214
- Three.
- Isn't that a lot?

716
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:39,655
- Nakahara, you're pretty funny.
- Uh? How many is many?

717
01:17:40,064 --> 01:17:42,892
- Well, 4 is many.
- Isn't that the same?!

718
01:17:42,954 --> 01:17:45,626
No! 3 and 4 are very different!

719
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:48,206
- It's the same!
- It's not!

720
01:17:48,252 --> 01:17:49,828
- It is!
- It's not!

721
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:52,951
- Meat is ready!
- And the vegetables.

722
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:57,222
Tanaka, this guy
is really weird.

723
01:17:57,259 --> 01:17:59,259
- Why?
- I'm not weird!

724
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:01,292
- You are!
- I'm not.

725
01:18:01,316 --> 01:18:05,140
You are. He said "I have
a lot of cameras...."

726
01:18:05,157 --> 01:18:09,044
How many? I asked. He says 3,
but I think from 4 is many...

727
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:12,129
- But I don't know, and...
- Indeed.

728
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:14,006
Nakahara, explain...

729
01:18:14,152 --> 01:18:16,383
Me? Why I have to explain?

730
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,866
This one is done.

731
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:22,056
- Here.
- Ouch, hot hot hot!

732
01:18:26,299 --> 01:18:28,479
- Scary!
- Careful.

733
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:30,135
I'm out of meat.

734
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:33,984
Hot!

735
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:37,030
I'm in tears.

736
01:18:39,277 --> 01:18:42,457
- The shrimps are delicious!
- Indeed.

737
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:45,830
- Did you try the chicken wings?
- Not yet.

738
01:19:01,142 --> 01:19:06,315
The one with the stick that last
the longest will have good luck.

739
01:19:12,594 --> 01:19:14,066
Go!

740
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,878
- Wait, she isn't your girlfriend?
- She is not.

741
01:19:55,244 --> 01:19:58,877
I mean... I don't think
I'm allowed to say she is.

742
01:19:59,444 --> 01:20:01,691
Uh? What do you mean?

743
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:08,458
Some relationships can only be
understood by the 2 people in them.

744
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:10,032
Right?

745
01:20:11,093 --> 01:20:12,742
So...

746
01:20:12,944 --> 01:20:15,759
you go to her when
she calls you...

747
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,819
and leave immediately
when she sends you away.

748
01:20:19,045 --> 01:20:23,935
That's not a girlfriend,
she's just using you!

749
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,000
Now you're making it sound
like she's an awful person.

750
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:30,203
But she is!

751
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:32,645
Right?

752
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:37,046
You're just sleeping
together, aren't you?

753
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:40,798
I guess...

754
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,865
Ridiculous.

755
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:49,995
What? Am I wrong?

756
01:20:50,128 --> 01:20:52,706
No, I think you're right.

757
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:56,210
Yeah, but...

758
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:59,797
Yoko is a kind person.

759
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:07,846
The fact she talks to someone like me,
even like that, it's enough for me.

760
01:21:08,816 --> 01:21:10,933
So are you happy with this?

761
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:14,414
No, it's just...

762
01:21:16,102 --> 01:21:18,356
You don't need to
worry about it.

763
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,610
Uh?

764
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:23,946
Why are you laughing?

765
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:28,489
Seriously, I'm talking
about your future.

766
01:21:28,544 --> 01:21:31,379
Why do I have to talk
about this with you?

767
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:35,532
Why are you being so direct now?

768
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:37,921
Yoko isn't an awful
person, period.

769
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:39,989
She is awful.

770
01:21:40,451 --> 01:21:43,682
- From what you said, she's awful.
- Okay, fine.

771
01:21:45,223 --> 01:21:46,302
Uh?

772
01:21:47,052 --> 01:21:49,138
Yoko is an awful woman.

773
01:21:49,785 --> 01:21:51,918
End of the conversation.

774
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:00,920
Tanaka...

775
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:03,357
what do you think?

776
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,064
What's up with this guy?

777
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,159
You know, I think...

778
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:16,290
that not everyone can
express love in the same way.

779
01:22:17,624 --> 01:22:22,485
Sometimes you're really in love,
so you can't say otherwise.

780
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,694
But if he's fine
with this, well...

781
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,638
Right, Nakahara?

782
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,070
Fine.

783
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:50,491
I'm making pasta.
You pissed me off.

784
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:54,745
So now I'll make
pasta for Nakahara.

785
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:58,791
I don't get it, what's this?

786
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:01,124
Tanaka, knives?

787
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,943
- Knives.
- Don't need a knife to make pasta.

788
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:08,759
- To cut the tomato.
- I didn't buy tomatoes.

789
01:23:14,453 --> 01:23:16,453
We have asparagus!

790
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:20,270
Nakahara, we have asparagus.

791
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:40,834
Don't force yourself.

792
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:44,253
- Leave it.
- That's a waste.

793
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:07,860
Teru...

794
01:24:08,757 --> 01:24:10,757
are you in love with Tanaka?

795
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:13,343
Uh? Why?

796
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,523
What do you like about him?

797
01:24:16,586 --> 01:24:19,931
What are you talking about?

798
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:25,668
I'm not good at romance.

799
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:32,656
In the end for some reason I always
feel like I'm just doing it for myself.

800
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:35,782
- For yourself?
- Yeah.

801
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:38,755
We get along, so we go out...

802
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:43,035
but I feel I'm doing it just
because I like to socialize.

803
01:24:43,896 --> 01:24:45,689
What do you mean?

804
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:50,068
Once I was going
out with this guy.

805
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:55,491
We would be on a date,
and I'd get hungry.

806
01:24:56,013 --> 01:25:00,081
I'd say "I'm hungry" and
he'd reply: "I'm not".

807
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:07,920
But when he was hungry, then we'd
immediately go to a restaurant.

808
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,200
Uh? Just for that?

809
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:16,500
I wouldn't be bothered
by something like this.

810
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:20,015
It's not fine! It's detestable!

811
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,976
You think so?

812
01:25:25,145 --> 01:25:27,022
But really...

813
01:25:27,418 --> 01:25:31,471
that's the reason you and
Tanaka would make a good couple.

814
01:25:37,755 --> 01:25:39,763
Why would you say that?

815
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:44,081
Hum...

816
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,918
Did you confess to Mamo?

817
01:25:51,416 --> 01:25:53,590
- Yeah.
- Really?

818
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:57,944
- Just kidding.
- No, really.

819
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,944
I didn't, I'm serious.

820
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:02,391
Really?

821
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:07,980
- You really like him!
- No, no, I swear.

822
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:10,607
Okay, listen.

823
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:12,963
I really didn't.

824
01:26:22,867 --> 01:26:27,165
After that trip, Sumire
often called me to hang out.

825
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:30,294
And every time, I invited Mamo.

826
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:34,506
But Mamo rarely called me.

827
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:39,116
Only Sumire called me.

828
01:26:39,964 --> 01:26:45,559
And yet, I couldn't hate her.

829
01:27:06,386 --> 01:27:08,724
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

830
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:51,977
- Yo!
- Yo.

831
01:27:58,555 --> 01:28:01,601
[Nakahara]

832
01:28:07,106 --> 01:28:09,343
What did you want to tell me?

833
01:28:10,394 --> 01:28:14,856
I think I stopped liking Yoko.

834
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:18,151
What?

835
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,472
I don't think I'll
see her again.

836
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:26,743
So maybe I won't see you either.

837
01:28:27,683 --> 01:28:30,619
That's why I wanted to
have dinner together.

838
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,480
I don't get it.

839
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:38,422
Why did you stop liking her?

840
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:44,678
Well...

841
01:28:45,421 --> 01:28:48,883
After that trip, I've
been thinking about it.

842
01:28:49,945 --> 01:28:51,685
About what?

843
01:28:55,271 --> 01:28:57,936
About me and Yoko.

844
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,051
I still don't get it.

845
01:29:17,566 --> 01:29:21,381
That day Mamoru said:

846
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:26,338
"It's okay as long as
they're both fine with it".

847
01:29:27,383 --> 01:29:29,931
- So?
- So...

848
01:29:31,179 --> 01:29:33,378
I thought I was fine with it...

849
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:36,521
and same for Yoko.

850
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:39,524
And yet...

851
01:29:39,746 --> 01:29:42,786
after what Sumire said
about it being awful...

852
01:29:42,839 --> 01:29:44,910
It doesn't concern Sumire!

853
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,872
I'm not good enough for Yoko!

854
01:29:58,607 --> 01:30:01,219
The other day I
suddenly remembered...

855
01:30:01,415 --> 01:30:05,574
this story about a chinese
king I heard a long time ago.

856
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,778
- A king?
- Yeah.

857
01:30:09,147 --> 01:30:11,531
He always had
unreasonable requests...

858
01:30:11,556 --> 01:30:14,922
but his vassals didn't want to
defy him, so they went along.

859
01:30:16,016 --> 01:30:19,168
His requests became
harsher and harsher...

860
01:30:19,302 --> 01:30:23,482
to the point that they couldn't
tell if he was just torturing them.

861
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:29,071
As for me...

862
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:33,203
I thought the king
was being cruel.

863
01:30:35,018 --> 01:30:36,748
But really...

864
01:30:37,967 --> 01:30:43,780
now I think his vassals, who kept doing
what he asked, were even more cruel.

865
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,390
In other words...

866
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:57,853
I don't actually
understand it...

867
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:02,594
but I've been wondering
what love really is.

868
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:14,035
What was that?

869
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:23,420
What is love.

870
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:27,485
What is love, you ask.

871
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:29,843
Uh?

872
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:32,532
Listen...

873
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:38,549
You said you'd do anything for
Yoko, didn't you? Now you're scared?

874
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,022
You said that.

875
01:31:42,104 --> 01:31:45,705
I want to be the person she
calls when she's lonely.

876
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:47,797
Even just that would be fine.

877
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:50,780
I said that.

878
01:31:52,059 --> 01:31:56,232
There are people like you
and me who feel loneliness...

879
01:31:56,934 --> 01:31:59,420
but Yoko doesn't.

880
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,440
That's why people like
us are attracted to her.

881
01:32:03,482 --> 01:32:06,463
I'm sure Yoko also
feels lonely sometimes!

882
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,454
I don't think so.

883
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,361
Everyone does!

884
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:13,336
You're only saying this
so you can give up.

885
01:32:13,659 --> 01:32:17,753
You think you're not going to get
her, just admit you're giving up!

886
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:23,139
That's right.

887
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:30,924
I'm not fine.

888
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,529
Everyone always
says "I'm fine"...

889
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:41,639
but honestly this is
too painful for me.

890
01:32:45,148 --> 01:32:46,920
You see...

891
01:32:48,902 --> 01:32:51,801
I love Yoko, I really do.

892
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:53,989
- Then you...
- Enough.

893
01:32:55,826 --> 01:32:57,722
Enough!

894
01:33:01,025 --> 01:33:02,672
That's it.

895
01:33:06,545 --> 01:33:09,359
There's a limit, you know.

896
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:20,351
I'm free to decide to give up.

897
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:51,234
I'm going home.

898
01:33:52,674 --> 01:33:54,821
It was nice to see you.

899
01:33:58,168 --> 01:33:59,851
Fool.

900
01:34:01,808 --> 01:34:03,808
You're a fool.

901
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:11,018
I just want to be happy.

902
01:34:12,756 --> 01:34:14,611
Oh, shut up!

903
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:41,486
Hey!

904
01:34:42,662 --> 01:34:44,100
Hi.

905
01:34:48,237 --> 01:34:51,586
[Yoko]

906
01:34:54,575 --> 01:34:57,056
- New hairstyle?
- Yeah.

907
01:34:57,823 --> 01:35:02,033
A coworker said this
style suits me more.

908
01:35:02,547 --> 01:35:04,182
What is it?

909
01:35:05,289 --> 01:35:07,102
A man?

910
01:35:07,936 --> 01:35:09,646
Yeah.

911
01:35:16,884 --> 01:35:18,488
What about Nakahara?

912
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:22,534
Nakahara? I haven't
seen him lately.

913
01:35:23,348 --> 01:35:25,495
He doesn't even
answer the phone.

914
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:34,504
Mom? Teru is here.

915
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:36,589
Can you bring something?

916
01:35:39,823 --> 01:35:41,636
You are not coming in?

917
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:43,179
Listen...

918
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:46,305
You're okay with this?

919
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:48,476
With what?

920
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:53,418
You can't get in touch with
Nakahara, are you fine with that?

921
01:35:54,053 --> 01:35:56,401
What? Why are you asking now?

922
01:35:57,515 --> 01:36:02,073
My point is... you
treated him like dirt.

923
01:36:02,807 --> 01:36:04,287
I feel bad for him.

924
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:08,246
It's your fault, why did you
ask him to go on that trip?

925
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:10,540
You don't care at all?

926
01:36:11,347 --> 01:36:15,356
I don't get it, you invited
him in the first place.

927
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:17,380
You told him to come.

928
01:36:17,537 --> 01:36:20,675
- He said yes.
- That's irresponsible!

929
01:36:21,645 --> 01:36:23,761
He didn't want to come.

930
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:26,973
Nahakara really liked you.

931
01:36:29,706 --> 01:36:30,831
So..?

932
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,605
Don't give me
that. You're awful.

933
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,148
What you're doing to Nakahara...

934
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:39,800
is no different from what
your father did to your mom.

935
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:41,404
Uh?!

936
01:36:41,821 --> 01:36:43,448
When, exactly...

937
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,556
when did you meet my father?

938
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:47,639
You know nothing about him.

939
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:51,080
- What do you know?!
- I don't!

940
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:53,436
But you're not kind.

941
01:36:53,861 --> 01:36:59,103
Listen... don't take it out with me just
because it didn't go well with Mamo!

942
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,030
You're just projecting!

943
01:37:02,053 --> 01:37:04,719
Uh?! No, I'm not!

944
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,242
"I'll cherish him!"

945
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:10,235
"I'll always take
care of Mamoru!"

946
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:13,542
That has nothing
to do with this.

947
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:16,918
Why did you come here?

948
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:20,632
If you've only come to talk
about this silly stuff, leave.

949
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:23,610
Sorry I don't feel
down like you do.

950
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:25,103
It's not silly.

951
01:37:25,823 --> 01:37:27,272
See you.

952
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,518
Wait!

953
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,015
What? You're not done yet?

954
01:37:34,354 --> 01:37:36,626
Don't you ever feel lonely?

955
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:38,461
What?

956
01:37:39,484 --> 01:37:42,799
I asked if you ever feel lonely!

957
01:37:43,614 --> 01:37:45,510
Of course I do!

958
01:37:45,671 --> 01:37:48,098
What kind of person
you think I am?

959
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:53,393
Whatever.

960
01:37:53,916 --> 01:37:55,548
What was that.

961
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:17,625
Teru?

962
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:21,865
Want a rice cake?

963
01:38:25,697 --> 01:38:27,468
Teruko?

964
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:30,263
Teruko!

965
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:00,501
Are you okay?

966
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:03,045
You look sad.

967
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:05,381
Do I?

968
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:12,722
Are you free later?

969
01:39:21,634 --> 01:39:23,725
It's nothing, come on!

970
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:26,527
What are you worried about?

971
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:29,781
Humans are pretty good at this.

972
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:35,507
Keep yourself busy, and you'll
forget about him in no time.

973
01:39:36,476 --> 01:39:38,476
Is that so?

974
01:39:38,604 --> 01:39:40,375
For sure!

975
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:42,731
I'm divorced, you know.

976
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,931
And if I think about it now...

977
01:39:46,157 --> 01:39:51,469
I have no idea why I even
loved him in the first place.

978
01:39:52,492 --> 01:39:54,612
I don't even remember his face.

979
01:39:59,605 --> 01:40:03,045
But I really love Mamo!

980
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:09,025
I love him!

981
01:40:09,635 --> 01:40:12,448
See, you can said it out loud:

982
01:40:13,138 --> 01:40:16,160
I'm in love with Mamo!

983
01:40:21,204 --> 01:40:22,834
Fine, then.

984
01:40:23,314 --> 01:40:25,920
He'll be with Sumire.

985
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:32,218
You're overthinking
it! Adults...

986
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:37,807
When I was young I
did overthink too!

987
01:40:38,038 --> 01:40:40,309
Everyone does that.

988
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:42,874
Shut up.

989
01:41:14,867 --> 01:41:17,472
- Hello?
- Hi.

990
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:20,287
Are you busy?

991
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:28,287
- Sorry, I don't feel well.
- Really?

992
01:41:28,672 --> 01:41:30,318
Are you okay? A cold?

993
01:41:30,727 --> 01:41:32,278
Probably.

994
01:41:34,614 --> 01:41:37,925
Sorry... what did you need?

995
01:41:38,866 --> 01:41:42,371
If it's about Sumire again...

996
01:41:42,644 --> 01:41:44,644
maybe another time.

997
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,668
It's not.

998
01:41:47,892 --> 01:41:50,303
I wanted to talk to you.

999
01:41:52,464 --> 01:41:53,940
Uh?

1000
01:41:55,532 --> 01:41:58,425
I'm at your house.

1001
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:23,329
Are you okay? Need
me to buy anything?

1002
01:42:42,398 --> 01:42:45,713
[Tanaka]

1003
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:23,639
- Here.
- Thanks.

1004
01:43:31,382 --> 01:43:33,717
- I'll eat.
- Go ahead.

1005
01:43:56,111 --> 01:43:58,111
- What?
- Nothing.

1006
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,413
- What?!
- Nothing!

1007
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:05,420
You helped me that time,
when I had a fever.

1008
01:44:05,913 --> 01:44:07,803
- Do you remember?
- I do.

1009
01:44:08,123 --> 01:44:10,686
You made udon for me.

1010
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:14,857
But...

1011
01:44:15,269 --> 01:44:18,309
Just the smell made me nauseous.

1012
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:22,262
- Uh?! Why didn't you tell me?
- Yeah...

1013
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,307
Sorry for bringing that up.

1014
01:44:28,018 --> 01:44:30,086
You know, that night...

1015
01:44:30,187 --> 01:44:34,251
I only had 327 yen
left to go back home.

1016
01:44:34,959 --> 01:44:36,601
I had to walk.

1017
01:44:37,173 --> 01:44:41,676
I'm joking. I went to a
friend's home and slept there.

1018
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,429
Really? You should have
came back to my house!

1019
01:44:45,994 --> 01:44:47,890
Yeah.

1020
01:44:55,754 --> 01:44:57,441
Listen...

1021
01:45:01,635 --> 01:45:03,766
Let's not meet again.

1022
01:45:08,517 --> 01:45:12,081
I mean, we're not dating, so...

1023
01:45:12,563 --> 01:45:13,999
It's...

1024
01:45:14,522 --> 01:45:17,235
It's a little weird, you know.

1025
01:45:18,277 --> 01:45:20,277
Our relationship...

1026
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:22,383
is strange.

1027
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:26,700
- Strange?
- Yes.

1028
01:45:27,216 --> 01:45:30,224
We hang out with
Sumire, 3 people...

1029
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:33,704
Isn't that weird?

1030
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:37,020
But that's...

1031
01:45:38,289 --> 01:45:40,769
I know she's not great for me...

1032
01:45:42,509 --> 01:45:46,449
but I actually like Sumire.

1033
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:51,175
She's unrefined...

1034
01:45:51,602 --> 01:45:55,777
she drinks too much,
and has bad skin.

1035
01:45:57,505 --> 01:45:59,276
I'm fine with that.

1036
01:46:00,027 --> 01:46:01,714
I like it.

1037
01:46:02,388 --> 01:46:04,201
I like her.

1038
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:06,228
Okay?

1039
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:09,328
Sumire was always saying:

1040
01:46:09,647 --> 01:46:12,752
"If Teru comes,
I'll be there too!"

1041
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:16,251
That's why we were
always inviting you.

1042
01:46:19,928 --> 01:46:24,326
- So what?
- You know, Sakamoto...

1043
01:46:25,636 --> 01:46:28,449
- Yoko?
- Yeah, Yoko Sakamoto.

1044
01:46:28,764 --> 01:46:31,368
The girl Nakahara loves.

1045
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:35,498
She called me.

1046
01:46:36,647 --> 01:46:38,647
- Yoko called you?
- Yeah.

1047
01:46:39,515 --> 01:46:42,488
"What you're doing
is nuts" she said.

1048
01:46:44,433 --> 01:46:49,447
That I was inviting you just
because I wanted to see Sumire.

1049
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:52,609
She said I was nuts.

1050
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:56,130
- When?
- Uh?

1051
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:59,548
- When did she call you?
- The other day.

1052
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:04,026
Maybe Nakahara
told her something.

1053
01:47:05,717 --> 01:47:07,717
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1054
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:13,642
I only realized how awful
it was after she told me.

1055
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:17,832
I didn't think at all
about how you'd feel.

1056
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:24,152
But after thinking about it...

1057
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:27,466
Well, I...

1058
01:47:27,907 --> 01:47:32,745
I see that when someone like you is
around, I act like a spoiled child.

1059
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:35,443
I only realized
because they told me.

1060
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:40,183
So...

1061
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:44,845
Let's do this.

1062
01:47:48,224 --> 01:47:50,067
Let's stop meeting.

1063
01:47:51,783 --> 01:47:54,256
I'll try hard.

1064
01:47:58,687 --> 01:48:00,291
Woah, Mamo.

1065
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:04,187
You sure are
confident, aren't you?

1066
01:48:04,381 --> 01:48:05,570
Uh?

1067
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:10,885
Did you really think I'd be
in love with you forever?

1068
01:48:11,979 --> 01:48:15,014
You're really something.

1069
01:48:19,244 --> 01:48:25,149
I really liked you, and
you often called me...

1070
01:48:25,353 --> 01:48:29,756
so I was hoping we would
start a proper relationship.

1071
01:48:30,052 --> 01:48:35,868
When I fall in love, I'm really
into it. I'm that kind of person.

1072
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:39,937
- But I've cooled down a long time ago.
- Really?

1073
01:48:40,198 --> 01:48:44,837
I think Yoko misunderstood the
reason I came to that summer trip.

1074
01:48:44,942 --> 01:48:49,965
I came because I wanted to be
introduced to your cool friend.

1075
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:54,595
But he didn't even
come, what a shame.

1076
01:49:00,072 --> 01:49:01,518
Woah.

1077
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:04,748
This is super embarassing.

1078
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:13,303
I wasn't being arrogant, I only
said that because Yoko told me.

1079
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,617
I see.

1080
01:49:21,687 --> 01:49:24,875
- That's embarassing.
- It is.

1081
01:49:30,014 --> 01:49:33,717
In a way, I'm glad.

1082
01:49:36,928 --> 01:49:39,633
This is great for me.

1083
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:42,568
We can be friends.

1084
01:49:43,452 --> 01:49:49,506
You'd be great as a friend
that is not emotionally close.

1085
01:49:54,136 --> 01:49:55,531
I'm so glad.

1086
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:59,827
I'm really happy you
don't actually love me.

1087
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:03,973
Isn't it nice?

1088
01:50:04,021 --> 01:50:07,581
So introduce me
to some cool guy.

1089
01:50:07,983 --> 01:50:12,047
We could go out on a
double date, with Sumire.

1090
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:14,695
I don't have a boyfriend...

1091
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,513
So instead of saying we
shouldn't meet, help me find one!

1092
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:21,890
Fine!

1093
01:50:30,964 --> 01:50:32,818
Let me try that.

1094
01:50:47,105 --> 01:50:48,876
Nice.

1095
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:00,661
Your hands are so nice.

1096
01:51:02,347 --> 01:51:05,434
Your hands are so pretty.

1097
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:09,396
What? Is that a good thing?

1098
01:52:43,722 --> 01:52:45,200
Hey.

1099
01:52:46,644 --> 01:52:48,146
How?

1100
01:52:49,713 --> 01:52:53,718
I looked up your name
and found out about this.

1101
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:35,042
[Teruko]

1102
01:53:35,233 --> 01:53:36,852
And this one...

1103
01:53:37,234 --> 01:53:39,087
- Cheese.
- Cheese!

1104
01:53:39,497 --> 01:53:41,497
And seedless tomato.

1105
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:44,176
- One of cheese.
- Yeah, one.

1106
01:53:45,788 --> 01:53:47,580
- Chees is good.
- It is.

1107
01:53:47,661 --> 01:53:49,806
Hey, look.

1108
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:55,297
- Hey, Kanbayashi!
- Good evening.

1109
01:53:55,878 --> 01:53:58,145
- Hello.
- Hello.

1110
01:53:58,511 --> 01:54:00,651
I'm Sumire.

1111
01:54:01,123 --> 01:54:03,177
- Yamada Teruko.
- Hey.

1112
01:54:03,244 --> 01:54:05,244
This is Kanbayashi.

1113
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:07,924
Nice to meet you.

1114
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,982
Excuse me.

1115
01:54:12,189 --> 01:54:14,831
You really don't
have a girlfriend?!

1116
01:54:15,799 --> 01:54:18,383
- I don't.
- How's that possible?!

1117
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:20,539
Is that by choice?

1118
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:22,433
No, he's just so busy!

1119
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:25,574
He even sends his laundry
to his parent's house!

1120
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:28,095
- Really?!
- That's not the reason!

1121
01:54:29,106 --> 01:54:32,474
Money is more important
than time for me.

1122
01:54:34,008 --> 01:54:35,308
I see.

1123
01:54:48,096 --> 01:54:49,750
Bathroom.

1124
01:54:54,269 --> 01:54:55,914
Come on, Yamada...

1125
01:54:56,104 --> 01:55:00,502
- Don't stare at him.
- I'm not!

1126
01:55:00,943 --> 01:55:02,943
Bathroom!

1127
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,158
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

1128
01:55:11,172 --> 01:55:14,068
- Should we order something?
- I'm good.

1129
01:56:21,607 --> 01:56:23,607
- Please.
- Thanks.

1130
01:56:24,776 --> 01:56:28,809
Should we split, later?

1131
01:56:29,114 --> 01:56:30,300
Uh?

1132
01:56:30,735 --> 01:56:32,149
I think...

1133
01:56:32,362 --> 01:56:35,799
Mamo wants to be
alone with Sumire.

1134
01:56:37,706 --> 01:56:39,265
I see.

1135
01:56:40,709 --> 01:56:43,814
Well... okay then.

1136
01:56:47,026 --> 01:56:48,752
See you later then.

1137
01:57:05,518 --> 01:57:07,986
Are you really okay with this?

1138
01:57:08,505 --> 01:57:10,132
With what?

1139
01:57:11,573 --> 01:57:15,111
Going this far just so
you can keep seeing him?

1140
01:57:18,173 --> 01:57:19,716
Yeah.

1141
01:57:21,143 --> 01:57:23,124
But why?

1142
01:57:23,418 --> 01:57:25,272
Is that love?

1143
01:57:27,499 --> 01:57:28,935
Love?

1144
01:57:30,551 --> 01:57:32,154
What's that?

1145
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:49,453
Even I don't undestand the
nature of my obsession with Mamo.

1146
01:57:51,446 --> 01:57:54,342
This is not romantic love.

1147
01:57:55,367 --> 01:57:57,367
It can't be love.

1148
01:58:25,731 --> 01:58:30,504
But it doesn't matter anymore.

1149
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,596
Uh?

1150
01:58:40,898 --> 01:58:42,898
Where are you two going?

1151
01:58:43,123 --> 01:58:46,326
To another bar. See you!

1152
01:59:06,313 --> 01:59:08,041
Why?

1153
01:59:08,732 --> 01:59:12,254
Me and Mamo are not one yet.
