Kawasaki

31
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,801
I've brought you
good shirts, haven't I?

32
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,185
I don't like this one.

33
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,671
It's good Kojiro.

34
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:04,982
You're wrong.
I'm Konosuke.

35
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:05,727
Kojiro!

36
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,224
- Michiko!
- Hanako!

37
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,780
- Sayuko!
-Ko...

38
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,359
Kosaburo!

39
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,722
This is Koshiro,
and baby here.

40
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:15,885
Too many kids!

41
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,596
Let's eat!

42
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:27,174
Daddy's pilfered goods
are cheaper than presents.

43
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,303
Silly! Pilfering is free.

44
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,330
Brother Konosuke
told me about that.

45
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,973
Don't tell

46
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,974
Were you loyal to me?

47
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:49,919
Don't be silty!
Of course I was.

48
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,697
One more bottle of beer.

49
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,966
Don't get drunk.
You must love me tonight.

50
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,677
- Michiko.
- What?

51
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:37,960
You're like your mama.

52
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:58,842
You better get married, Momo.
Do you want me to be your wife?

53
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,346
My wife is my truck.
I'll always be with her.

54
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,621
Welcome back.

55
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:13,732
Take  these watermelons.

56
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,537
You pilfered a lot!

57
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,824
It's part of a driver's skill
to pilfer goods.

58
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:30,213
I once pilfered 10 cases
of frozen prawns.

59
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:32,462
Poor consignors!

60
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,481
It's a part of freight.
They know that.

61
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:38,224
Then I'll take them.
Thanks.

62
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,460
I'll come back later.

63
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,677
I'll have her.

64
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:26,636
Darling, make love to me...
It's been a while...

65
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,281
Wake up.

66
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,966
Papa, I wanna piss.

67
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,664
MONA LISA OKYO

68
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:53,682
- Just arrived?
- Getting ready for bed?

69
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:58,090
I had girls at the bathhouse.

70
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:02,184
You better sleep with a man
once in a while.

71
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:04,338
You, lecherous ape!

72
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,784
A present for you.

73
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,032
A widow should get married again.

74
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:13,429
You should get married.
You look filthy.

75
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:16,427
You scum!

76
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:37,908
Lousy driving!

77
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,666
Look at the damage!

78
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,500
It's only a lamp!

79
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,078
He's at it again.

80
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,101
Stop it!

81
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:05,740
What do you think a highway is?
It's not a private driveway!

82
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,825
Matsushita!

83
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:12,890
You were a policeman,
Shame on you!

84
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,945
You're wasting your words,
Captain.

85
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,124
he drove a squad car while drunk.

86
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,744
And he got fired.
He's a disgrace to us.

87
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:26,299
Can't Imagine he was once
feared by truck drivers

88
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,338
as "the devil.”

89
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,354
I'm sorry for being picked up so often.

90
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:35,345
Officer.

91
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:42,228
He quit the police force.

92
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,803
You're mean to say so.

93
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,467
Yes, I definitelty
quit the police.

94
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,595
Quit the police?

95
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:52,777
Ass! The police isn't a gang!

96
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,071
To us truck drivers...

97
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:59,430
it's a gang of terrorists.

98
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:03,003
What?
You insult the police?

99
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,543
Thanks a lot.

100
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:25,391
If you were held,
you wouldn't fight again.

101
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,163
Not again!

102
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,239
Fix me up too, Okyo.

103
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,128
The first aid kit
is in my truck, Kinzo!

104
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,141
Okyo, don't you want a man?

105
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,151
Your breast must be
crying for one.

106
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,553
Don'! fight again!

107
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:07,273
All right!

108
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,018
Hurry up! I can't wait!

109
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,443
Easy.

110
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,209
Are you constipated?
Hurry!

111
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:30,380
Pardon me.

112
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:33,422
It wasn't me.

113
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,515
Where has that nasty guy gone?

114
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:39,638
First Star, give me paper.

115
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,565
Don't say such a thing.
You're rude.

116
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,282
Use your hand.

117
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:09,445
There was a funny guy
in the can.

118
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:11,873
How are you, Viper?

119
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,598
Are you in good shape, Rover?

120
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,167
Hi, Jonathan!

121
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:22,594
Hello, Virgin! Do't eat to much
or your joint'll shrink.

122
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:28,646
- First Star, Here I am!
- Come!

123
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,197
Where are you going?

124
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:47,377
I wanna piss.

125
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:48,847
You did.

126
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,234
You can't drink from it!

127
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:08,834
Sister!

128
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:12,398
What do you want, sir?

129
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,254
A cup of coffe.

130
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,584
Coffee? Don't make me laugh!

131
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:20,132
I'm not hungry.

132
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,609
You? You eat like a horse.

133
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:24,580
You'd better order.

134
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:29,068
Fried leeks, pork stew
and a big bowl of rice.

135
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,572
Wait. Are you new?

136
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:37,416
You're beautiful.

137
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,292
I'm Jonathan.

138
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,734
I'm Yoko. How do you do?

139
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,745
I'm Momojiro!

140
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,998
Nobody hears you.

141
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,934
Wait a minute!

142
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:56,351
You're just like my dead wife.

143
00:19:58,337 --> 00:20:00,442
Why are you working here?

144
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,752
For money.

145
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:09,514
She must have some special reason.

146
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:13,881
A rich man's daughter
working in a hash-house.

147
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,285
If you have a problem,

148
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:20,444
tell me about me.

149
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:28,006
We're now friends.

150
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:31,607
Tell me about your trouble.

151
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:33,830
I'll be moved to tears.

152
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:37,474
Don't cry. Just tell me.

153
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,312
Don't ask!

154
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:44,025
Every man has a past
he wants to conceal.

155
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,930
For example, I started
to work as a truck driver,

156
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:51,495
but before...

157
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,442
You'd been a driver.

158
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:56,741
Everyone jas a reason.

159
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:01,190
You're right. Each person
has his own reasons.

160
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,169
We can't go to Hokkaido,
leaving her here.

161
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:09,836
Hokkaido?

162
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,552
"Hamanasu" must be pretty.

163
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,106
<i>“Hamanasu”?</i>

164
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:29,936
It must be a flower.

165
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,892
"Hamanasu” must be beautiful.

166
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:52,097
We couldn't find
"hamanasu" in Hakodate.

167
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,229
Maybe in Shiretoko.

168
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:58,207
- I'll go to Shiretoko,
- You can't go there.

169
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,242
Let's see stripers.

170
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:05,135
I'll be moved to tears.

171
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:12,215
Save me from these hoodlums!

172
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,640
You slob!

173
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,108
What are you doing?
Get down!

174
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:36,960
Can't you read this notice?

175
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:41,053
Can't you read these letters?

176
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:42,702
Fool!

177
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:51,320
Save me! I beg you!

178
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,240
He tried to run
with our boss' woman.

179
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,473
Let's heat these truck
jockies first!

180
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:27,749
He's recovered from lovesickness.

181
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:32,497
You seduced a stripper
and were thrown out, eh?

182
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:39,492
There's no place for me to go.
Hire me as tour assistant.

183
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:43,341
- We don't use assistants.
- I ain't asking you.

184
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:45,191
Please, President.

185
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,585
You mean me?

186
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,224
Say it again.

187
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:58,507
I'll repeat it many times,
President. President!

188
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:03,032
What a beautiful truck!

189
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:08,041
When compared with this,
Rolls' and Caddies are just jalopies.

190
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:12,803
On the contrary, this one looks
like a junkman's truck.

191
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:15,213
What did you say?

192
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:17,556
He said, "a junkman's truck."

193
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:22,279
You can understand art.
I like you.

194
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:26,192
President Momojiro Hoshi.

195
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,371
- Hey, let him join us.
- What do you say?

196
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,226
You two make a team.
I don't care,

197
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:40,704
<i>“Hamanasu”?</i>

198
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:45,849
I need "hamanasu",
even if they're withered.

199
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:50,111
You're in Aomori.
There's no "hamanasu" here.

200
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:55,474
Do you want to kill
a man who's lovelorn?

201
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:58,016
A man's life depends
on that flower.

202
00:25:58,197 --> 00:26:00,495
What's a "hamanasu” flower?

203
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,988
There's very red flower here.

204
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:11,869
This'll be all right.

205
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:14,651
It's called a carnation in this town.

206
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:28,712
Look, hand this flower
to that beautiful lady in there.

207
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:39,167
You have a keen eye
for women's beauty.

208
00:26:40,472 --> 00:26:42,713
She's prettier than
those I loved.

209
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,430
I see.

210
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,297
She's just like
an image of "hamanasu."

211
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:50,624
I'll act as Cupid.

212
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:13,629
You've had me and now
you feel better, right?

213
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:18,362
I do, but my wallet
feels worse.

214
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:29,991
Lay me.
I'll give you a discount.

215
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:33,111
I haven't had
a customer for 2 days.

216
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:35,317
Not me. Get another sucker.

217
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,132
- Get something to eat.
- Thanks.

218
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:30,229
Did you give
that flower to her?

219
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,271
She wants to thank you,
but she's too shy to see you.

220
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,512
Order something for us.

221
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:42,193
Waitress,
take my boss' order.

222
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:47,833
What do you want?

223
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,155
I don't need you, chick.

224
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,772
What's the big idea,
dirty driver?

225
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,773
Do you have champagne?

226
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:58,607
No champagne for truck drivers.

227
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:14,705
Yoko, dear.

228
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,619
Hello, Jonathan.

229
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:20,136
This is for you.

230
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,634
All of them?

231
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,565
Don't care. All of them
are yours, Yoko.

232
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,089
They're all pilfered. Damn it!

233
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:32,070
Thank you very much,
Jonathan.

234
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:36,473
I'll eat them
with my friends.

235
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:42,388
I don't want to eat
with these fags.

236
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:53,365
Filthy ape with loose bowels!
Pipe down!

237
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:21,326
Momo.

238
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,211
This man told me
about you.

239
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:30,513
I didn't know
you're in love with me.

240
00:30:32,304 --> 00:30:34,580
How romantic!
I like carnations.

241
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:38,676
- Carnations?
- So pretty.

242
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:42,227
Let's start, Okyo.

243
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:46,416
Momo, when you get back
to Kawasaki, let's have a talk.

244
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,077
I made a mistake.

245
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:02,918
Are you Momojiro Hoshi?

246
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:12,127
I'm "Draon" of Shimonoseki.

247
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:15,716
I came from Kyushu to race you.

248
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,102
All right. I'll take you on.

249
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:27,035
- How much?
-It's up to you.

250
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:31,644
300,000 yen.

251
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,455
That's chicken feed.
But it's enough for you.

252
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,509
Stop! Stop, President!

253
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:13,055
I don't want to die!
I'm still young!

254
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,583
Damn you!

255
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,503
Drink if you have time.

256
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,793
Step aside, losers.

257
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:08,982
Dragon, you made it.
I knew you'd easily win.

258
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:13,904
Hey, First Star,
drink with us.

259
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,693
My boss didn't lose the race.
I stopped him.

260
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:21,111
You talk too much.
We can't make excuses.

261
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:24,528
I'm..

262
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:28,471
... the loser.

263
00:35:29,134 --> 00:35:30,602
Bravo, First Star!

264
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:32,879
You're a good loser.

265
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,917
Senkichi, your pants are wet.

266
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:36,945
You pissed, eh?

267
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,809
Please drink, Momo.

268
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,145
You, too.

269
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:52,864
I won't lose next time.

270
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:58,956
I'm sorry, Boss. I made
you lose 300,000 yen.

271
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:01,687
I don't care.
It's chicken feed.

272
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,870
You're rich.

273
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:07,149
Money can't make you happy.

274
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:09,451
Right?

275
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:11,255
Could be.

276
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,453
But some people are sad
because they have no money.

277
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:21,604
What do you mean by that?

278
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,860
Now I see.

279
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:31,797
Boss, she's broke.
The best way to get her is money.

280
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,208
I know.

281
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:37,367
I've known for a long time.

282
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:51,337
I want one more.

283
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:55,511
Let's play,
"Kill the Dragon" with this.

284
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:58,524
You won't be welcomed
by girls.

285
00:36:58,657 --> 00:37:02,651
Attach these to the inside of your truck.

286
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:12,142
Neon lights.

287
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,193
Neon lights?

288
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,856
Good idea, You convinced me
I'll be moved to tears.

289
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:26,674
You're crazy.
Don't make me laugh.

290
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:32,767
Come.

291
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:36,814
What do you want?
Say it! I'm busy!

292
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,534
You want to give me the brush-off?
I misjudged you.

293
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,426
Why are you angry?

294
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:48,672
Don't grumble like a woman.

295
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:52,698
Like a grumbling woman?
You can call me anything.

296
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:54,509
Well, goodbye.

297
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,987
Did you call me out
to say goodbys?

298
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,640
Goodbye! I'll leave
you forever.

299
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,802
We were pals.

300
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:12,774
We talked all night
in the snow.

301
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:18,633
We talked about how to sell you
as No. 1 truck driver in Japan.

302
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:24,285
That's why I took you to brothels
and treated you to drinks.

303
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:27,184
Money is nothing!

304
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,155
Don't talk nonsense!

305
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:33,293
You like that lousy tramp!
Damn it!

306
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,603
Do you think our friendship
is nothing?

307
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:44,600
"My darling, Yoko"?
"I be moved to tears"? Nonsense!

308
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:48,807
Are you insulting Yoko?

309
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,951
If so, I'll never forgive you.

310
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:59,029
All right! Let's fight
to end our friendship!

311
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:01,909
Come on, First Star!

312
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:11,989
Stand up!

313
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:33,705
Jellyfish!

314
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:53,952
You fool! You know
nothing of life!

315
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:05,416
Your left hook is best, Boss.

316
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:09,430
Really great.

317
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:15,639
I'm glad you shook off
that jealous old man.

318
00:40:16,688 --> 00:40:19,441
Jonathan didn't act
like that before.

319
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:24,073
Police are all power freaks.
He's just warped.

320
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:27,907
Maybe he was a stool-pigeon.
He has a sly face.

321
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,243
Idiot!

322
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:32,113
Jonathan's a pro.

323
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:35,457
You're just a greenhorn!

324
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,102
Get down and cool your head.

325
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:42,088
I didn't mean to insult him.

326
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,089
I respect you, Boss.

327
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:53,472
He's so cold.

328
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:06,109
MOTEL MOMOZONO

329
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:28,052
What's wrong?

330
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:32,220
Where's Momo?

331
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,013
He dumped me.

332
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:42,882
Get in and stop crying.

333
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,435
Cheer up!

334
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:56,202
I'll talk to Momo about you.

335
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:58,666
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

336
00:42:58,816 --> 00:42:59,874
Thank you.

337
00:43:01,486 --> 00:43:03,272
I was wrong about this.

338
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:11,294
My boss asked me to give them
to a pretty girl in the eatery.

339
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:14,640
He actually meant Yoko.

340
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:17,914
But you're prettier to me.

341
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,524
Later I got hell from my boss.

342
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:44,543
Hey, bring wine!
Can't you hear me?

343
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,936
Jonathan, what happened
to "First Star"?

344
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:50,134
He doesn't get drunk
that easily.

345
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:52,360
I don't care.

346
00:43:52,604 --> 00:43:54,447
Ask the moonfaced bum..

347
00:43:55,473 --> 00:43:57,316
He came here alone.

348
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,119
What's the matter?
Bring wine!

349
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:05,164
Oh, you're pumping gas.

350
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:10,834
Now I understand.
I didn't know.

351
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,495
Any woman'd pick him.

352
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:17,540
He's skillful and a nice guy.

353
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:21,321
Yoko, you have a good eye for men.
Bravo for both of you!

354
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,387
Don't get the wrong idea.

355
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:31,962
Don't touch me!

356
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:37,515
You sold yourself,
I was wrong about you!

357
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,740
Take it all!

358
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,647
You're a fool, Momo!
You got the wrong idea!

359
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:56,576
Pipe down!

360
00:44:57,902 --> 00:45:01,406
Because of me and Midori here,
Yoko went to the motel.

361
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:06,441
While I was having
Midori four times...

362
00:45:07,345 --> 00:45:10,053
...some thief stole my clothes.

363
00:45:11,482 --> 00:45:16,648
That's why Yoko came to the motel
to bring my lover's clothes.

364
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:19,974
Why didn't you say so first?

365
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:21,661
You're always careless.

366
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:30,842
The money!

367
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,779
What's so funny?

368
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,955
He's wrong again.

369
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:06,581
He's senile now!

370
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:16,295
Yoko!

371
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:23,937
Forgive me.

372
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:35,511
I offered this money.
Please accept this for me.

373
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:38,416
Stop it.

374
00:46:40,004 --> 00:46:45,113
If I accept that money,
I won't be able to accomplish my aim.

375
00:46:49,113 --> 00:46:54,426
First Star, if you're a real man
take back that money!

376
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:58,916
Shut up! Don't butt in!

377
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:07,209
Let's fight!

378
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,873
I'll call the police.

379
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:18,925
Don't! It's between drivers!

380
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,232
Brother, stop fighting!

381
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:59,321
Stand aside!

382
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:01,516
Brother!

383
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,940
Did you come
from Kyushu to fight?

384
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:11,504
We haven't settled this.

385
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:22,392
Those two are brother and sister?

386
00:50:26,397 --> 00:50:30,163
That man you're in love with
is strong and good.

387
00:50:31,435 --> 00:50:32,596
I like him.

388
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:35,105
Forget about him, Brother.

389
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:37,823
Make Mom happy...

390
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:41,566
Force him to marry you
if you have to.

391
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:46,375
You're a shrew.
He'll be good for you.

392
00:50:47,251 --> 00:50:51,643
I had the wrong idea, Brother.

393
00:50:53,124 --> 00:50:55,946
Actually, I don't like him.

394
00:51:00,965 --> 00:51:02,649
You're a fool.

395
00:53:00,985 --> 00:53:02,123
I'm thirsty.

396
00:53:02,419 --> 00:53:05,229
Let's get dressed
and get some beer.

397
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:14,765
Hello, little girl,
who put you here?

398
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:16,947
Daddy.

399
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:19,385
Where's your daddy?

400
00:53:20,404 --> 00:53:21,644
Went shopping.

401
00:53:33,617 --> 00:53:35,392
What's that?

402
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:40,065
"Please take care
of this child.

403
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:44,017
"Her name is Yumi Terayama.
Please raise her."

404
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:48,210
Momo, she's been abandoned.

405
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,288
What'll we do?

406
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:55,639
Take her to the police?

407
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,589
The police'll send her
to an orphanage.

408
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,788
Lousy father!

409
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:08,658
A parent must raise his child,
even if he has to steal.

410
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,187
I'd take her in, but...

411
00:54:13,123 --> 00:54:14,511
I'll take her.

412
00:54:16,193 --> 00:54:18,207
You have seven kids already.

413
00:54:18,529 --> 00:54:20,805
Seven or eight.
Makes no difference.

414
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:22,788
What's one more?

415
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:29,062
Your hands are dirty.
I'll take it for you.

416
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:31,522
I's tasty. Eat more.

417
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:35,713
How could her father abandon
such a cute girl?

418
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:38,038
- A foundling?
- Kojiro!

419
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:39,529
I'm Konosuke.

420
00:54:39,683 --> 00:54:41,674
Konosuke and you all,
help her.

421
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,736
Yumi'll be a member
of the Matsushida family.

422
00:54:44,888 --> 00:54:46,242
She's your sister.

423
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:48,462
We must live helping
each other.

424
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:55,251
Momo, you better get married.
Don't you have a girl in mind?

425
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:58,310
"I'll be moved to tears."

426
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:00,244
Stop joking.

427
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:03,980
You should marry a good-natured woman.

428
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,763
I'm lucky.

429
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:11,096
You're my superiors daughter,
but you respect me.

430
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:17,677
My father was a police chief.

431
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:20,696
He told me a woman
should be reserved.

432
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:23,967
I married a man socialy
far below me.

433
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:28,042
But we're leading a good life
because I'm reserved.

434
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:31,466
He was of the lowest rank.

435
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:43,705
What made you become
a truck driver, Okyo?

436
00:55:45,082 --> 00:55:47,119
You think it's a man's job?

437
00:55:52,323 --> 00:55:55,520
When I think about it,
it was probably just a woman's pride.

438
00:55:58,028 --> 00:55:59,951
I got married at 16.

439
00:56:00,998 --> 00:56:03,604
Two years later,
we bought a truck

440
00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:05,748
and looked forward
to our future.

441
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:08,126
Then my husband
was crushed to death

442
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:11,530
by the truck.

443
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,745
How?

444
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:17,414
He got under the truck
to change a tire,

445
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:22,505
It fell off the jack.

446
00:56:26,924 --> 00:56:28,369
I resented it.

447
00:56:30,327 --> 00:56:32,523
But I didn't hate the truck.

448
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:38,456
We worked hard to buy it.

449
00:56:41,438 --> 00:56:43,782
I decided to drive it for him.

450
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:53,161
But I'm planning to sell it now.

451
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:56,571
You quit?

452
00:56:58,021 --> 00:56:59,580
I'm a woman.

453
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,453
After the next trip...

454
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:07,949
I'll go back to Kyushu
in my brother's truck.

455
00:57:36,226 --> 00:57:37,887
- Hello!
- Yoko!

456
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:41,539
No work because of rain?

457
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:47,534
You team up again?

458
00:57:48,439 --> 00:57:51,454
Momo said he couldn't
live without me.

459
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:53,975
You two seem like a couple.

460
00:57:55,612 --> 00:57:57,660
Don't think I'm a fag.

461
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,452
Give me
some European-style dishes.

462
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:07,347
Boiled vegetables
and pork soup!

463
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:09,595
I'll have the same.

464
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,488
Another special.
And coffee.

465
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:19,443
She likes me...
Just as I thought.

466
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:21,357
Stop jumping the gun.

467
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:26,876
Brother.

468
00:58:27,377 --> 00:58:28,276
Okyo.

469
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:32,431
I was shocked to learn
you're his sister.

470
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:35,633
You're like him.
You're both reckless.

471
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:59,556
Okyo'll disappear from me today.

472
00:59:01,778 --> 00:59:03,701
I must propose now.

473
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:06,554
Okyo.

474
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,277
Should I call her, "Kyoko"?

475
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,437
Okyo, please marry me.

476
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:22,755
Okyo, I'm a useless guy.
I'll fail no matter what I do.

477
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,704
I was kicked out of school
and the army.

478
00:59:27,671 --> 00:59:29,287
I failed as an actor.

479
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:34,729
But no one will love you
more than I do.

480
00:59:36,213 --> 00:59:37,624
Not even Momojiro.

481
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:44,839
I swear I'll make you happy.
Please, Okyo!

482
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:47,491
<i>Please many</i>

483
00:59:48,592 --> 00:59:51,664
I'll go anywhere you want.

484
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:04,116
Hello, Gailant!

485
01:00:04,975 --> 01:00:07,012
I heard you.

486
01:00:07,344 --> 01:00:09,164
You're a good actor.

487
01:00:19,122 --> 01:00:24,515
"Please Okyo!
Please marry me."

488
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:28,825
You're not fit for her.

489
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:31,230
Her brother is "Dragon".
He'll beat you up.

490
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:35,265
He said he was once an actor,

491
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:38,077
but he was
a stripper's assistant,

492
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:57,920
Stop it! Shut up!

493
01:00:58,695 --> 01:01:00,652
What's funny?

494
01:01:01,264 --> 01:01:03,801
He asked his girl to marry him.

495
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:07,537
Is that funny?

496
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:09,589
Not to me!

497
01:01:10,474 --> 01:01:12,852
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

498
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,329
Okyo, isn't that so?

499
01:01:43,373 --> 01:01:45,159
I'm a failure.

500
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:48,245
Cheer up!

501
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:22,490
Senkichi, thank you.

502
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:28,116
I gladly accept your proposal.

503
01:03:30,747 --> 01:03:34,377
know I'm not worthy,
hut please make me your wife.

504
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:00,004
I'm glad.

505
01:04:15,592 --> 01:04:17,026
Take care of her.

506
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,055
I think you lost
a very nice girl.

507
01:04:38,148 --> 01:04:39,274
Go to her.

508
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:42,800
Go to Okyo.

509
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:20,738
Good luck!

510
01:05:23,493 --> 01:05:26,099
I hope you'll get
a nice girl.

511
01:06:47,344 --> 01:06:49,073
Here comes Momo!

512
01:06:58,355 --> 01:06:59,607
Fill it up!

513
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:12,453
- She's a peach.
- Is she?

514
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:24,436
It's a tip. Take it.
It's chicken feed.

515
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:31,082
Hey, boys, he gave us a tip.

516
01:07:35,058 --> 01:07:36,981
Let's thank him.

517
01:07:39,462 --> 01:07:40,987
Fall in!

518
01:07:41,631 --> 01:07:43,668
Thank you, Sir!

519
01:08:05,655 --> 01:08:07,612
Thanks,
That was a great help.

520
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,180
Shall I wait?

521
01:08:11,895 --> 01:08:14,842
You don't have to.
I'll take a train.

522
01:08:14,931 --> 01:08:15,944
I see.

523
01:08:40,857 --> 01:08:42,848
She's a rich man's daughter.

524
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:58,036
“Nebuta Festival"!
I wish I could dance there.

525
01:08:58,141 --> 01:09:00,109
I used to dance.

526
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:03,432
On the night of the festival,

527
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,799
we kissed each other,
didn't we?

528
01:09:07,283 --> 01:09:08,910
You were so eager.

529
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,730
You were so eager
my lips swelled.

530
01:09:57,467 --> 01:09:59,003
Daddy! Daddy!

531
01:10:00,603 --> 01:10:01,684
Daddy?

532
01:10:07,644 --> 01:10:11,865
Momo, she must've come
from Aomori.

533
01:10:15,952 --> 01:10:19,855
Maybe she's been there.

534
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,844
Maybe we can find
her father here.

535
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:32,225
Momo, let's bring her to Aomori.

536
01:10:32,635 --> 01:10:35,434
And let her dance.

537
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:37,331
Aren't you happy?

538
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:10,320
I suppose she danced
with her daddy last year.

539
01:12:12,835 --> 01:12:15,349
I'll take you
to the Star Festival in Sendai.

540
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:20,060
It's a great festival, too.

541
01:12:29,018 --> 01:12:30,042
Yumi!

542
01:12:31,754 --> 01:12:33,165
You're Yumi!

543
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:44,668
Her father was killed
by an explosion in the tunnel.

544
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:49,503
He was blown to pieces.

545
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,653
We had to collect him
in a basket.

546
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,616
Look, Yumi. Do as I do.

547
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:07,178
Uncle, what's this?

548
01:13:09,058 --> 01:13:13,985
I guess the reason
why Terayama left her

549
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:15,747
in a truck.

550
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,192
He might've hoped
another driver

551
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:22,603
would take care of her.

552
01:13:23,573 --> 01:13:24,893
Driver?

553
01:13:29,245 --> 01:13:31,862
A long-distance driver.

554
01:13:33,483 --> 01:13:36,430
His licence was suspended for six months

555
01:13:36,786 --> 01:13:39,574
for being overweight
and speeding.

556
01:13:40,456 --> 01:13:44,711
He couldn't pay the installments.

557
01:13:46,662 --> 01:13:49,404
He got sick,
and his wife ran away.

558
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,190
He told me there was
a mean traffic cop.

559
01:13:56,672 --> 01:14:03,191
The cop was very strict.
He wanted to get promoted.

560
01:14:05,047 --> 01:14:06,833
Who was he?

561
01:14:08,284 --> 01:14:09,866
I forgot.

562
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:16,599
But his nickname was
"The Devil's weight-examiner

563
01:14:16,692 --> 01:14:18,069
"of Hanamaki. "

564
01:14:22,432 --> 01:14:24,924
The Devil's Weight-examiner?

565
01:14:32,175 --> 01:14:35,634
The weight-examiner!

566
01:14:36,212 --> 01:14:39,887
He was Kinzo Matsushita,
a fraffic cop.

567
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,197
I want to hang him!

568
01:14:42,518 --> 01:14:44,896
Don't blame yourself,
Jonathan.

569
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:47,140
What's done is done.

570
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:53,502
A man can't understand
unless he acts as others do.

571
01:14:54,597 --> 01:14:56,577
When I was a cop...

572
01:14:56,999 --> 01:15:00,594
I regretted that people
didn't obey the laws.

573
01:15:02,605 --> 01:15:07,657
But I now know if drivers obey
the laws, they can't live.

574
01:15:13,282 --> 01:15:14,636
Your license!

575
01:15:15,451 --> 01:15:18,352
Six tons overload.
Get out!

576
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:35,918
Damn! I'll be suspended.
How heavy is your load?

577
01:15:36,105 --> 01:15:37,573
Eighteen tons.

578
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:43,355
I'll have to be a laborer.

579
01:15:49,685 --> 01:15:52,336
I'm sorry, Officer.

580
01:15:52,755 --> 01:15:54,177
Come!

581
01:15:54,657 --> 01:15:57,308
I'm sorry. Let me off!

582
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:16,834
Hey, you guys! Never mind
the lousy cops! Go!

583
01:16:17,313 --> 01:16:20,977
I'll be responsible.
Everybodym take off.

584
01:16:25,288 --> 01:16:27,928
I'll handle this.

585
01:17:03,726 --> 01:17:05,433
Mommy, Room No. 3?

586
01:17:30,152 --> 01:17:31,244
Kimie!

587
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:34,608
Darling!

588
01:18:03,419 --> 01:18:04,864
It's coming!

589
01:18:06,255 --> 01:18:07,484
What's up?

590
01:18:07,723 --> 01:18:10,693
An ambulance!
We need an ambulance.

591
01:18:10,793 --> 01:18:12,716
Easy! This is an hospital.

592
01:18:28,644 --> 01:18:31,978
The baby's big.
It's healthy.

593
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:34,959
This is the eight child.

594
01:18:35,718 --> 01:18:37,766
Actually Number Nine
because there's Yumi.

595
01:18:37,953 --> 01:18:39,773
We'll have a dozen soon.

596
01:18:39,989 --> 01:18:41,650
No more, thank you.

597
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:43,668
No more love-making.

598
01:18:45,528 --> 01:18:48,520
Momo, you should have kids.

599
01:18:48,764 --> 01:18:51,779
I have no field
to sow my seeds in.

600
01:18:54,336 --> 01:18:56,236
Your field, Momo.

601
01:18:57,406 --> 01:19:00,478
It's about farming.

602
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:04,594
Mrs. Matsushita, this is Yoko
from the restaurant.

603
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:07,217
Favor me from now on.

604
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:09,895
Momo,
you have a very good field.

605
01:19:11,087 --> 01:19:15,365
I was surprised, but I'm glad
you weren't hurt bad.

606
01:19:16,592 --> 01:19:18,913
You have a cute baby.

607
01:19:29,538 --> 01:19:35,489
We must be the go-betweens
for his marriage.

608
01:19:35,745 --> 01:19:37,827
Leave it to us.

609
01:19:38,714 --> 01:19:40,716
It's too soon.

610
01:19:43,352 --> 01:19:47,084
Uncle, when do we go
10 the Star Festival?

611
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:52,029
The festival's being held today.

612
01:20:04,373 --> 01:20:05,909
It's beautiful.

613
01:20:06,408 --> 01:20:09,252
I feel relaxed
for the first time in years.

614
01:20:10,045 --> 01:20:11,911
You like festivals?

615
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:18,372
Why ask such a question.
You know I do.

616
01:20:19,188 --> 01:20:23,307
Maybe you don't know,
but I know all about you.

617
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:28,623
Don't try to hide it.

618
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,072
Hide what?

619
01:20:32,568 --> 01:20:36,562
Never mind. I'll keep it
in my heart.

620
01:20:44,513 --> 01:20:50,657
Looking at Yumi, a woman said,
"She looks like your husband."

621
01:20:51,887 --> 01:20:53,173
Husband?

622
01:20:53,455 --> 01:20:54,923
She meant you.

623
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:58,006
Me?

624
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:03,089
She asked me,
"How long have you been married?"

625
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:06,349
It was embarrassing.

626
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:11,711
People are apt to think
we're man and wife.

627
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:14,876
Let'em think so,
my husband.

628
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:22,288
Okay. Shall we, a family of three,
have a nice meal?

629
01:21:22,852 --> 01:21:24,411
All right, hubby.

630
01:21:47,977 --> 01:21:49,103
Akira!

631
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:53,265
What are you doing here?

632
01:21:56,585 --> 01:22:00,260
I've been thinking of us

633
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,952
while I've been working here.

634
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:11,013
I found we weren't defeated
by money at all.

635
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:13,483
But by ourselves.

636
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:17,057
Let's start over.

637
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,765
Go back to a life where we have
to live with sixty percent

638
01:22:22,544 --> 01:22:23,921
of my salary?

639
01:22:24,046 --> 01:22:27,232
We have to. You killed a man
by running over him.

640
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,062
That's whu I've paid for three years.

641
01:22:32,955 --> 01:22:36,983
I can't pay the 60 million yen
indemnity in my whole life.

642
01:22:40,362 --> 01:22:42,171
The man was rich.

643
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:45,758
One day, I brought money
to the family.

644
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:49,513
The victim's son said,

645
01:22:51,173 --> 01:22:55,201
"This much won't even pay
for a night's drinking in Ginza. "

646
01:22:56,412 --> 01:22:58,232
That's what he told me.

647
01:22:59,815 --> 01:23:01,590
What an insult!!

648
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:05,086
Do I have to live like that?

649
01:23:06,855 --> 01:23:08,687
I can't stand it!

650
01:23:14,697 --> 01:23:16,222
Listen, Yoko.

651
01:23:17,733 --> 01:23:20,236
I decided to take a tuna boat

652
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,572
at Shimokita at noon tomorrow.

653
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:28,644
I'll never come back to Japan.

654
01:23:32,247 --> 01:23:35,581
I wanted to see you
and beg your forgiveness.

655
01:23:38,053 --> 01:23:42,524
Because of me, you changed
your course of life completely.

656
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,416
I feel guilty. I want you

657
01:24:12,254 --> 01:24:14,586
to find a nice man
and start over.

658
01:24:16,692 --> 01:24:20,026
I think you can be happy.

659
01:24:22,364 --> 01:24:24,219
- Goodbye.
- Wait!

660
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,261
You're going to run from trouble
for the rest of your life?

661
01:24:29,438 --> 01:24:32,089
I've made up my mind.
Goodbye.

662
01:25:07,576 --> 01:25:08,657
Yoko.

663
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:19,122
Yoko,

664
01:25:20,556 --> 01:25:24,550
I have something important
to tell you.

665
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:27,695
Please listen.

666
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:32,296
"Of course."

667
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:38,993
Please accept
this "hamanasu" flower.

668
01:25:41,276 --> 01:25:42,846
"How beautiful!"

669
01:25:45,414 --> 01:25:50,420
This flower tied us
to each other.

670
01:25:52,454 --> 01:25:54,024
"Do you remember?"

671
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:57,466
Marry me.

672
01:26:06,168 --> 01:26:08,751
Oh, Momo, you've come early.

673
01:26:09,505 --> 01:26:13,260
The flowers are beautiful.

674
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:16,844
Where's Yoko?

675
01:26:37,766 --> 01:26:38,744
Yoko.

676
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:46,900
I've come to ask you
something important.

677
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:49,430
Please listen.

678
01:26:50,512 --> 01:26:52,469
Please acceot this "hamanasu."

679
01:27:27,816 --> 01:27:29,329
What's up?

680
01:27:35,824 --> 01:27:37,098
Hold me!

681
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,750
Do anything to me.

682
01:27:50,872 --> 01:27:51,771
Yoko!

683
01:27:54,276 --> 01:27:55,573
What's up?

684
01:27:59,748 --> 01:28:01,147
What happened?

685
01:28:10,826 --> 01:28:12,897
I don't care
what happens to me.

686
01:28:13,562 --> 01:28:14,814
Calm down.

687
01:28:15,163 --> 01:28:17,063
Tell me what's wrong.

688
01:28:17,466 --> 01:28:19,332
I don't care what happens.

689
01:28:37,686 --> 01:28:38,972
I had...

690
01:28:41,056 --> 01:28:42,603
...a sweetheart.

691
01:28:49,331 --> 01:28:52,915
He's going to leave Japan today.

692
01:29:06,581 --> 01:29:08,333
I won't see him again.

693
01:29:14,423 --> 01:29:15,970
Who is it?

694
01:29:23,398 --> 01:29:25,992
He was my classmate
in middle school.

695
01:29:28,303 --> 01:29:31,762
When I was studying
to be a nurse...

696
01:29:33,175 --> 01:29:36,850
He was working
at an automobile repair shop.

697
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,970
We promised to marry.

698
01:29:45,587 --> 01:29:48,989
Don't lie! You went Into
your mansion in Tokyo.

699
01:29:49,691 --> 01:29:50,886
You're wrong!

700
01:29:53,662 --> 01:29:55,517
I took money to them.

701
01:29:57,966 --> 01:29:59,036
Money?

702
01:30:03,605 --> 01:30:09,567
He killed the head of the family.
He fell asleep while driving.

703
01:30:13,982 --> 01:30:15,882
The victim was a VIP.

704
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:21,362
Akira worked hard
and continued to pay.

705
01:30:26,328 --> 01:30:29,343
One day he brought money,

706
01:30:32,734 --> 01:30:36,932
and the victim's son
threw it away.

707
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:43,926
He said it wouldn't even pay
for a night's drinking.

708
01:30:45,714 --> 01:30:48,820
Since then he lost
his will to pay.

709
01:30:50,619 --> 01:30:52,496
He quit the repair shop.

710
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:58,214
Nobody can accuse him.

711
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:04,533
The employees of the repair shop

712
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,481
were forced to work overtime.

713
01:31:09,471 --> 01:31:12,543
That's why he fell asleep
at the wheel.

714
01:31:16,044 --> 01:31:18,479
He's like us truck drivers.

715
01:31:42,838 --> 01:31:45,102
Go to him, I'll drive you.

716
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:47,529
- It's too late.
- No!

717
01:31:48,043 --> 01:31:51,286
It'll take eight hours
to get to Shimokita.

718
01:31:51,913 --> 01:31:54,405
'I make it in three yours.

719
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:58,768
Forget it. We already
said goodbye.

720
01:31:59,054 --> 01:32:03,981
Don't be silly!
You have to start over again.

721
01:32:04,459 --> 01:32:05,346
Come on!

722
01:33:00,515 --> 01:33:03,541
Hey, you In that eleven-tonner,
pull over!

723
01:33:11,426 --> 01:33:13,690
Pull over!

724
01:33:13,962 --> 01:33:17,683
Shut your big mouth!
We're in a hurry!!

725
01:33:40,855 --> 01:33:44,587
Out of the way, flatfeet!
You're blocking the road!

726
01:35:13,548 --> 01:35:14,709
You okay?

727
01:35:19,654 --> 01:35:22,897
Start all over again
with him!

728
01:35:33,034 --> 01:35:36,447
Two and a half hours.
A new record.

729
01:35:43,912 --> 01:35:45,107
Don't cry.

730
01:35:46,781 --> 01:35:48,875
Men don't like weeping girls.

731
01:36:06,301 --> 01:36:07,302
Thank you.

732
01:36:16,444 --> 01:36:17,514
Akira!

733
01:36:21,049 --> 01:36:21,948
Yoko!

734
01:36:25,153 --> 01:36:26,757
Akira, don't go!

735
01:36:27,655 --> 01:36:29,783
We have to start over again.

736
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:34,026
Let's work to make a go of it.

737
01:36:34,796 --> 01:36:36,969
Yoko, why did you come here?

738
01:36:37,432 --> 01:36:38,968
We mustn’t run.

739
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:42,854
Let's face It
and go on with our lives.

740
01:36:45,273 --> 01:36:46,570
Face it?

741
01:38:07,188 --> 01:38:12,103
THE END
