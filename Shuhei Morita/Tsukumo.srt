00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,790
Possessions
(Tsukumo  - Tsukumogami)

2
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,790
I've sadly lost my way inside this rainstorm.

3
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,290
Please, I will like you to let me rest here until the rain stops.

4
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,730
What does this mean? What’s going on?

5
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,010
Are you comfortable here?

6
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,930
Make yourself feel like home.

7
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,930
My umbrella has been broken.

8
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,020
It's broken and pretty useless.

9
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,150
We'll have to toss it to the trash.

10
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,700
Straight to the trash.

11
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,290
Some fine umbrellas are these!

12
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,330
I'll borrow one!

13
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,620
¿Huh...?

14
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,470
I'm going back.

15
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,770
I'm going back! I'm going back!

16
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,760
Am I pretty?

17
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,930
Pretty.

18
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,270
Pretty... was being said by all.

19
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,860
But...

20
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,780
Fashion change in any moment.

21
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,950
What is out of fashion is stored in the drawer.

22
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,370
Hey... 

23
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,080
Am I Pretty?

24
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,220
Nice flowered ball

25
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,470
Shame these have been dumped...

26
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,020
... They are good!

27
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,140
I'll borrow them!

28
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Beautiful.

29
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,190
I'm just a traveler passing by.

30
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,400
Lost my way under the rain.

31
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,980
So I made myself at home in a corner of this shrine, but it seems occupied.

32
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,240
If you excuse me.

33
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,620
So... would you let me out?

34
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,510
That's a very nasty smell.

35
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,700
If my journey led me here...

36
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,370
... I'm expected to throw away the trash.

37
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,490
But... Before that

38
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,010
I must not forget...

39
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,090
Before I ascend, thank you for your welcome and help...

40
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,680
...good work.
