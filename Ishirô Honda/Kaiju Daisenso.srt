Fuji, call World Space Authority (W.S.A.)

W.S.A here, report your position

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,800

Correct speed to 0.005

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,200
Keep it there until further notice

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Speed corrected to 0.005

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,700
How is it going, everything alright?

47
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:02,739
Yes, food and accommodation are fine
We could do with some exercises, though

48
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,134
Well, you'll have plenty of it on Planet X

49
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,200
Professor?

50
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:10,608
Yes?

51
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:11,954
Is my sister Haron around?

52
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:13,572
Haron....eh?

53
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:17,815
Can't spot her

54
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,264
Please, can you take a message for her?

55
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:21,909
Tell her not to make a foolish decisions

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,276
Foolish what...?

57
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:24,182
Indeed!

58
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:26,800
Tell her to stop being so naive!

59

End of transmission

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,800
What's so funny?

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,479
Blow me, you're sure being her brother?!

62
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,717
You don't know her like me

63
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,182
Thank you

64
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:42,656
What's that all about between Fuji and you?

65
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,964
My brother has old fashioned
ideas about partnership

66
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,211
He wants me to move within
the boundaries of our family

67
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,179
making him sometimes behaving...

68
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,434
Sorry bothering you with my problems

69
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,364
Oh, that's not a problem for me!
It seems you brother has problems

70
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:05,050
to accept your recent partner?

71
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:05,711
Indeed

72
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:08,959
So, we found you eventually!

73
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,132
Sorry, forgotten!
Don't worry...

74
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:13,258
Professor, press waiting for some time...

75
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,046
I see, this way, please

76
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:27,102
Your friend, what's he doing anyway?

77
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:28,998
He is an inventor

78
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:30,231
Inventor?

79
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:47,100
Tetsuo, stop it, its unbearable!

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,084
You'll make the baby cry!

81
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:53,911
Is this sound loud enough?

82
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,428
It's heard from the other end of the road!

83
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,788
You make yourself heard, even so

84
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,560
why can't I find someone to buy you?

85
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,616
Tetsuo, Tetsuo!

86
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,651
I've turned it off already!

87
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:13,850
Someone's for you on the phone!

88
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,699
Coming!

89
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:17,156
If this 'Lady guard' shrieks

90
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:18,466
similar to her, things are sorted!

91
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,213
Thanks

92
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,340
No problem

93
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,688
Hello

94
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:28,420
Tetsuo Toori, that's me...

95
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,343
...a sales contract?

96
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
According to you Professor Sakurai

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,600
this new planet was found behind Jupiter

98
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Yes

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Why wasn't it discovered before?

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,700
Unknown objects shortly coming and
going is not unusual our galaxy

101
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,900
That one was not a bright one either,
hence difficult to detect

102
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,700
We calculated this body orbits
the sun once every 17.000 year

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,100
We also received artificial waves which

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,200
we could track down to this new planet

105
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Does this indicate intelligent life forms?

106
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,500
We don't know yet, there could be

107
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,200
other reasons for these signals

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,100
So we have to rely on the P-1 crew

109
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,899
to ascertain more information

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,229
Tetsuo...

111
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,132
Seems to be very posh here,
how can you afford it?

112
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,686
Don't worry I've got good news,
I sold my invention!

113
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,227
Really?

114
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:55,357
I am going to sign a contract soon

115
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:56,800
Whom you sold it to?

116
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,352
A so called World Education Corporation

117
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,168
A big company, produces toys for education...

118
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,744
Oh, and I supposed...

119
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,796
What?

120
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,889
Are you Tetsuo Toori?

121
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,373
Yes, that's me

122
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:16,469
Sorry for keeping you waiting I'm
Namikawa, World Education Corporation

123
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,335
Here our contract, including the
licence fee agreement which we

124
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,072
will pay once it's on the market

125
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,700
Looks fine to me

126
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:29,810
Or...?
Of course...

127
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:33,679
Is this your wife?

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, but I am working on it...

129
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,700
May I introduce to you, Fuji Hano

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,788
Nice to meet you

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,448
You work for the W.S.A, don't you?

132
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,032
And your brother is Fuji, one of
the astronauts there...?

133
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:49,085
You know him?

134
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:53,657
No, but everybody is interested

135
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:56,642
in his recent task in space...

136
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:04,872
Well... mmh?

137
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,239
Isn't this strange?

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,366
What do you mean?

139
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,007
All of the sudden, a simple gadget

140
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,433
is worth a fortune, very suspicious!

141
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:17,076
Big universe keeps your family
busy, so don't look down on those

142
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:18,700
who make a living from small universal ideas

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,095
You lost touch to the ground...

144
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,100
Don't exaggerate!

145
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,900
Exaggerating?

146
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,200
You're brother thinks I am useless
Let's see what he thinks now

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,424
My success will teach him some devotion!

148
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,938
Glen, I think there is something wrong!

149
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:34,483
Wrong?

150
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,216
My fault, navigation error
We need to make a 180 degree turn

151
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
O dear!

152
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,639
Look Fuji, Jupiter...

153
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,104
Planet X will be just behind it

154
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,300
Look, there it is!

155
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,319
W.S.A.
P-1 calling

156
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,356
W.S.A here, pass your message

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,403
P-1 approaching Planet X

158
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:21,990
I want you to be very careful

159
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:23,119
Of course

160
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,930
Shall we explore the landing area?

161
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:30,511
I cannot object from down here

162
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:33,323
P-1?

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,584
Are your reading?

164
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:36,800
Affirm, nothing to worry

165
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,163
Like my father, business before pleasure!

166
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,629
We lost contact, they are on
the dark side of Jupiter

167
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:57,766
Glen, can you see anything?

168
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,800
mmh..., ya...

169
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:09,261
Rocks, possibly an ocean and ice...

170
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,038
Let's get ready, check the instruments

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
The radar-thermometer reads 15 degrees

172
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,700
15?

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Far too warm, keeping in mind
this planet's distance from the sun

174
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
The universe still bears secrets...

175
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,116
Radiation check...

176
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:27,976
Negative

177
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Okay!

178
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,400
Hey, is it safe?

179
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,700
Okay, fine!

180
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Glen, have a look

181
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,220
I'll put the flag on that ridge

182
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:22,501
In the meantime I'll adjust the telemeter

183
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:36,839
Fuji!

184
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:41,288
2/3 of Earth's gravity
0.5 of Earth's pressure

185
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:43,500
Mmh..., half of Earth's pressure?!

186
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,107
Fuji, what the hell was that?

187
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,515
A lightning most likely

188
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,150
Strange, lightning but no clouds

189
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,152
Everything alright with you?

190
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:05,439
Yes

191
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,312
Fine...

192
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,449
Glen, I can see footprints!

193
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,016
They're not from animals

194
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,818
They are from humans!

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,073
Glen?

196
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:48,256
Do you read me, Glen?

197
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,223
Glen!

198
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,031
Where are you, Glen?!

199
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,044
Fuji, get in here!

200
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,674
Move in here immediately!

201
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:27,701
Who are you?

202
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
You have to rush!

203
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,405
This is a dangerous area!
For your own safety

204
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,320
move into this shuttle immediately!

205
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:36,740
Who are you?!

206
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:39,678
We are, using Earth's terms,
the life forms of Planet X

207
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:43,275
Aah...

208
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,085
We are sorry but get in here!

209
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,342
Glen and P-1 are already here

210
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,071
Okay!

211
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Professor, we've lost contact with P-1

212
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,600
Check the emergency channel!

213
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,134
Negative, no signal

214
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,200
Professor!

215
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,991
Don't worry, I have faith in them

216
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,199
We also lost no lives for 3 decades

217
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,190
I am sure both are alright

218
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,100
Follow that light in front of you

219
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:49,100
Glen..., Glen!

220
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,123
Are you alright?

221
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,016
Ya, what about you?

222
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,636
Ah, I'm fine

223
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,157
Stay where you are...

224
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,756
We apologize for any inconvenience,
please make yourself comfortable

225
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,800
I am the commander of this planet

226
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,500
I've got an issue to discuss with you

227
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,707
The reason we made this arrangement

228
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,083
Arrangement? What is the topic?

229
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,452
Where is our ship P-1?

230
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,107
You don't need to worry

231
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,583
It is in this area, perfectly safe

232
00:18:59,005 --> 00:18:59,847
Incident report!

233
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,528
Monster Zero striking again!

234
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,964
Monster Zero...

235
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,042
All units, take defensive positions!

236
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:10,258
Comply!

237
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:11,300
What is Monster Zero?

238
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,007
A dreadful space monster terrifies
our world since 12.000 years

239
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,100
Since that time the underground

240
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,200
is the only safe place on this planet

241
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,300
Monster Zero is striking!

242
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
Report location!

243
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,800
At position C3-M7, I repat C3-M7!

244
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Clear area!

245
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,500
I'll show you Monster Zero...

246
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:46,200
Look!

247
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,688
King Ghidorah!

248
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:48,704
Indeed

249
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,100
That's how you name it on earth

250
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,500
Here we like to enumerate them

251
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,568
Why can't you get rid of it?

252
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,400
We tried everything,
obviously without success...

253
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,400
That's why you are here and

254
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,800
we'd appreciate your input!

255
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,311
What do you gonna do about it now?

256
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,500
We have to persevere until it leaves

257
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,894
Surface collapse at Sector 16!

258
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,575
Move there, area clearing procedure!

259
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,100
Emergency! Emergency!
Incident at sector 15


260
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,258
The hydrogen-dioxide plant is damaged!

261
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,068
Evacuate sector 15!

262
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,068
Affirm...

263
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,259
Obviously, something serious happened

264
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,800
And they don't want us around

265
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,954
All nations have securities to hide...

266
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,208
Hydrogen-dioxide, that's H-2-O-2...

267
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,800
a chemical resembling water...

268
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,100
That's right!

269
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,194
Nothing to worry about...

270
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,560
Monster Zero has vanished

271
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,608
You had an incident at the water plant?

272
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,289
A minor industrial accident...

273
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,639
I am sorry leaving you here, but

274
00:21:57,674 --> 00:22:00,928
that was for concerns of your safety

275
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,952
Well...where did we leave off?

276
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,162
17000 years ago, on our last visit
in your solar system, we found on Earth

277
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,141
depauperate humans and two giant creatures,
We need now to destroy Monster Zero

278
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,349
Monster One and Monster Two...

279
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,917
You call them Godzilla and Rodan

280
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Godzilla and Rodan?

281
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,400
Indeed!

282
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,131
King Ghidorah can only be overpowered

283
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:39,155
if Godzilla and Rodan merge their strength

284
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,263
So, will you support us?

285
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,419
Well, I can't tell you

286
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,900
about their whereabout on Earth

287
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,700
Anyway, how can you catch them

288
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,579
and move them up to your planet?

289
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Godzilla in Lake Miojin, Japan
Rodan in Washikazawa, Japan

290
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,400
We need permission to land on Earth

291
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:10,279
also for catching and removing
them to this planet

292
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:14,188
We will be very grateful in return

293
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:19,102
Mankind suffers an incurable disease, cancer...

294
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,844
We will share the knowledge of healing it

295
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,200
Explain our situation to your people

296
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,900
why we need Earth's support

297
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
You have our empathy and we will

298
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,200
try to convince them

299
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,200
I hope you manage that in time

300
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,800
We wish you decent journey home

301
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,500
It was our pleasure to meet you

302
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Fools...

303
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,700
"P-1 returns from Planet X"
"Uneventful flight"

304
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Without a doubt, the content of

305
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,100
Fuji's and Glen's report is incredible!

306
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
A new planet discovered, natives found

307
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:37,900
with advanced knowledge of
technology and medicine

308
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Seeking confidence, friendship
and help from the Earth people

309
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,200
The World Council has to discuss
a proposal of Planet X regarding

310
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
their application of enter Earth

311
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:06,100
They promised us an ultimate
therapy for cancer in return

312
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,900
It will be interesting to
find out know how it works...

313
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,200
Which chances this drug bears
on other severe illnesses...

314
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,280
The people from Planet X need help

315
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:23,816
in a state of utmost emergency

316
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:25,223
As a matter of humanity we have

317
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:30,017
to give all support needed

318
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:31,238
So, there is only one conclusion...

319
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:40,700
The World Council grants permission
the people of Planet X to move

320
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,100
Godzilla and Rodan up to their planet

321
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,226
Search units are already on their
way to the named locations

322
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:34,206
Sorry for keeping you waiting...

323
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,275
Namikawa is out of town,
maybe I can help you?

324
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:45,815
It's about my invention, the 'Lady Guard'

325
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,616
Your progress of going on the market...

326
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:49,968
Aah, we still need more tests on it

327
00:27:50,574 --> 00:27:53,925
It's already in working condition!

328
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,743
I demand to see your manager!

329
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,200
Boss!

330
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,300
He's gone?

331
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,300
Not yet, he insists to see you

332
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
He might become a problem for us

333
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,800
Get rid of him

334
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:23,406
decently...

335
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:33,018
My brother wants to meet us today

336
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:34,594
regarding your invention and so...

337
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,400
I don't want to see him today

338
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,500
Don't be rude

339
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,200
The World Education Corporation
takes care of you

340
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,127
Your sister's late, huh?

341
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,300
She always late

342
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,100
You can't bear someone stolen
her heart?

343
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Coffee, please

344
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,100
You've got an arrangement?

345
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Actually, I'm waiting for someone

346
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,100
This Japanese girl?!
Race doesn't matter for you?

347
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,100
If only a girl's past is important to you

348
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,600
you'll probably never fall in love!

349
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,200
I am concerned whether Planet X
may suffer a severe water shortage

350
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
after that plant accident...

351
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,600
That's what I am thinking either

352
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm also concerned whether we
should trust them anyway

353
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,400
Sorry for keeping you waiting...

354
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,600
Are you always late?

355
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,900
Good evening, Glen

356
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,500
This way, please

357
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,400
Tetsuo, your invention, going well?

358
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,100
Eh, yes!

359
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,400
'Lady Guard'...

360
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,300
I am be surprised that someone
is willing to pay you so much

361
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
I haven't received any money, yet

362
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,800
That's what I supposed anyway...

363
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,100
I know my sister and I can't think
a dreamer will make her happy!

364
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,600
Well, of course...

365
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,300
Tetsuo, don't surrender to him!

366
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,100
Glen, tell me, isn't mutual faith

367
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,100
in relationships superior to money?

368
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,800
I think so, actually it is inevitable

369
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,100
Glen, why don't you mind your business?

370
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,200
Hang on, I am simply answering a question!

371
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,600
Faith only won't fed neither of them

372
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,200
Well, but faith has got a higher
value in everyday life than money

373
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,800
As ususal, supporting the ladies...

374
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,600
Excuse me, please

375
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Oh, you wanna go?

376
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,400
I've got an arrangement

377
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,200
I know him, stubborn as a mule,
so better use a decent whip!

378
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:00,290
Oh, it's Namikawa!

379
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,500
Look at this!

380
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,100
So that's his arrangement...

381
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Glen is an adult, which does not

382
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,400
apply to both of you, unfortunately!

383
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,300
Wait...

384
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,400
What shall we do now?

385
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,100
I'll go and find out why Glen's date

386
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,268
couldn't see me earlier today...

387
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:42,600
It's increasing!

388
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,700
Captain!

389
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,613
What's the matter?

390
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,400
Radiation levels are increasing

391
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,300
Serious?

392
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Alarming radioactivity Lake Myôjin floor!
Godzilla located, Tôkyô his target again?

393
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,405
According to Planet X people,
Rodan's detection only a matter of time

394
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,200
Professor, did they find Godzilla?

395
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,500
They found him at the bottom of the lake

396
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,600
The commander from Planet X was

397
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,700
right about Rodan's whereby too

398
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,400
Hey, what's wrong?

399
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
You take the wheel

400
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,500
Hey Glen, what are you on about?

401
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,300
Doesn't this road lead to Lake Miojin?

402
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,300
Ya, went this road with my date

403
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,800
Do you have something to confess?

404
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,100
Listen, I am serious now

405
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,400
I think these guys from Planet X
are already on Earth

406
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,500
You mean they came prior to our consent?

407
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
We spend the night in a bungalow there

408
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,100
I woke up in the night and saw
them standing in front of me

409
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,500
That was a dream!

410
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,167
That's what I thought initially either

411
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,278
Well, did they say anything?

412
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,900
Yes, 'All things done and nothing
to worry about'

413
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,300
I wonder what it refers to?

414
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,900
I can't tell you, but what did the girl say?

415
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,100
The only thing she noticed was my snoring

416
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,900
I'm concerned whether we had too
much faith in Planet's X people

417
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,100
with unforseen consequences...

418
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
It is possible they don't have
any water up there at all, thus

419
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,968
considering moving down to the earth

420
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Alright, let's go and check that bungalow!

421
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,800
Go on!

422
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,800
Stop!

423
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,700
We are on behalf of the W.S.A

424
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,500
Commander!

425
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,900
I'm Fuji, we are from the W.S.A
I'm Glen

426
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,700
We'd like to examine that bungalow

427
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,600
You must be joking, look over there!

428
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Godzilla!

429
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,100
Take defence position!

430
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,400
Defence position!

431
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,600
Hurry!

432
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,600
A flying saucer!

433
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,700
Glen!

434
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,900
I see, they'd been here already!

435
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,900
Gosh darnit!

436
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,300
General, all units on standby...

437
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,400
Shall we open fire?

438
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Wait!

439
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
They are not from the earth...

440
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,848
These are the people from Planet X...

441
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:30,100
They're coming towards us...

442
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,354
The one in the middle is the commander

443
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,808
We are going to tie a strong galactic bondage

444
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,900
between Earth and Planet X

445
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,600
We are grateful for your support

446
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,700
and we shall be grateful for that

447
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,400
Shall our friendship last forever

448
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
'Feign' speech is understatement

449
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,463
We appreciate what you are saying,
though, doesn't that include

450
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,500
an obligation for disclosing
all kind of information too?

451
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,114
You came to our planet, hiding
in this lake thus disregarding

452
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:27,220
our authority and rights to object...

453
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:29,900
My apologies for this intrusion,
but we had the concern that

454
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,900
all of the sudden Godzilla and

455
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,500
Rodan may start to damage Earth

456
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,200
How'd you gonna move Godzilla
and Rodan anyway?

457
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,200
We've got a special nuclear field
which can carry items

458
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,100
of any size and weight through space

459
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,100
You doubt it?

460
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,500
These two flying saucers will
be the transport vessels

461
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
This one is heading for Washikazawa

462
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,400
All units, follow that saucer
and keep me informed

463
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,100
Move on! Move on!

464
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,200
There it is!

465
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,100
Godzilla, it's Godzilla!

466
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,200
Glen!

467
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,100
You wouldn't believe it!

468
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
Incredible!

469
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,500
Glen...

470
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,600
Time to go

471
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,100
Okay

472
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,500
This is Rodan!

473
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Rodan!

474
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,600
Are they alright?

475
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Yes, they won't notice this as
they won't their space travel

476
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,600
Soon we will get the secret drug formula

477
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,600
Is Glen joining you?

478
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,649
Yes, so does Professor Sakurai

479
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,500
What do you think, Glen dating Namikawa?

480
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,238
Don't ask me, ask Glen

481
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,700
Glen, I can't let you go!

482
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Listen Namikawa, I'll be back soon

483
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,100
Glen, you don't know what you will face!

484
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,300
So what, nobody can predict the future...

485
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,100
Take care

486
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,900
I promise to marry you once I'm back

487
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,200
Follow that car!

488
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,200
Please, make your way in...

489
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
Take your seats, please

490
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,200
May I ask you doing us a favour?

491
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,500
What are you after?

492
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,100
We'd like to see the control room

493
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,400
That's where you in right now!

494
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,600
This is it?

495
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,300
Only my brainwaves are needed to

496
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,500
operate and navigate the entire ship

497
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,600
So, feeding your thoughts into the computer

498
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,200
navigates the ship into the right direction?

499
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,900
That is correct

500
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Can you do that with everything?

501
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,800
Almost...

502
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,800
You got a high intellectual mind

503
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,900
I shall feed that into the
memory board of our computer

504
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,200
Backup status?

505
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,700
Backup terminated!

506
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,800
You seem to be impressed?

507
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,200
No vibrations at all, what an
advantage in compare to our ships

508
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,300
How can you pass the orbit
with Godzilla and Rodan?

509
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,100
They are entirely safe in these vessels

510
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,100
Not feeling anything

511
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,900
Speed according to our calculations

512
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,500
450000000 m/h

513
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,500
What, 450 million per hour ?

514
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Affirm

515
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,900
That will take us only 4 hours, 30 minutes

516
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,600
At the moment, we are restricted
to 1/10 of light speed

517
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,800
The speed of light?

518
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,200
Soon we will be able to sped
same as the light does...

519
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,100
You wanted to have a word with me?

520
00:44:50,543 --> 00:44:55,256
You became far to engaged with
the human called Glen

521
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,900
It's not my fault being a woman

522
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,500
No feelings, no emotions!

523
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,400
Only obedience to commanders!

524
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,200
I will comply!

525
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,500
The inventor named Tetsuo is on the island

526
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,600
What?!

527
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,200
Yet another project you've handled poorly!

528
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,059
We shall be landing soon

529
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,800
Glen, be cautious...

530
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,300
You too, mate!

531
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,100
Monster One and Monster Two on approach!
All units on standby

532
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,700
Standby, roger!

533
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,300
What are those pipes for?

534
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:01,800
They are part of our water pumps

535
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,800
Water is very rare here, thus very precious

536
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,600
All units, prepare!
Monster Zero is approaching!

537
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,500
You see, Professor Sakurai...

538
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,600
This time Monster Zero will face
an equal opponent

539
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,800
And that was only possible
because of Earth's support

540
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,100
I am very grateful for that

541
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,500
What so many generations waited for...

542
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,200
Monster Zero has been driven out

543
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,288
Where have your companions gone?

544
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,200
I haven't got a clue...

545
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:03,137
Security, person allocation!

546
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,500
We don’t know where to start....

547
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,200
We need to find out what the
commander is on about

548
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,700
I don't have a high opinion of him

549
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,200
Let's go back, we soon gonna be missed...

550
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,500
That's what we are already...

551
00:51:36,688 --> 00:51:37,546
Gotcha, get in!

552
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,800
Too late, lets' inform the commander!

553
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,974
Let's see where it leads us to...

554
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:53,688
It's air-conditioned, so we could stay here!

555
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:16,014
This yellowish stuff is...Gold!

556
00:52:17,664 --> 00:52:20,200
That's why gold isn't as precious as water

557
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,900
The more when ground-water lacks too

558
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,900
Someone is coming...

559
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,300
Namikawa!

560
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,100
Glen, Glen!

561
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,100
Namikawa, how did you get here?

562
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,600
I see, you are one of them, and
I was your target, isn't it?!

563
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,500
Glen, we ought to go!

564
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,800
You can take down your hands

565
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,100
It is a matter of great concern,
walking around without permission

566
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,500
Well, your limited sightseeing tour

567
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,100
left us with curiosity behind

568
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,100
Anything of importance found?

569
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,800
Seems to be more gold than fluids

570
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,900
Well, we are not really short of both

571
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,200
Plenty of water will be soon applicable

572
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,300
Really, and how?

573
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,100
That's not your business...

574
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:02,100
Actually, why do all the women on
Planet X look the same?

575
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,300
Aren't they are all very beautiful?

576
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,823
Yes, but beauty is more than a skin layer...

577
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:10,200
Beauty is what's in the heart

578
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,100
Let's not argue about this

579
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:20,200
Seriously, you both broke our rules

580
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,400
As a matter of hospitality this will not

581
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,142
have consequences for you this time

582
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,354
Have our apologies...

583
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:52,300
Now to our part of the deal

584
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,300
This tape contains the information
for the cure of cancer

585
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,700
It is yours...

586
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,100
Thank you so much!

587
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,400
Your spaceship is waiting for you

588
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,400
There is P-1!

589
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,400
That's not our P-1!

590
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:26,280
On your last visit, our computer
stored each detail of your P-1

591
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,112
This ship was reassembled
based on these data taken

592
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,100
Look, Godzilla and Rodan!

593
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,800
Both seem to be alright...

594
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,900
Professor, I wonder if we're
doing the right thing

595
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,800
What do you mean?

596
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,800
Look at Godzilla and Rodan

597
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,100
We can't leave them behind...

598
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,600
Come on, we had too much
trouble with them anyway...

599
00:56:07,752 --> 00:56:09,543
But don't worry, they'll
find their way home

600
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,200
Everything ready for take off?

601
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,100
Okay!

602
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,900
This copy of P-1 is working very well

603
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,500
You soon will find out that this is more

604
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,204
than a simple duplicate of the original ship

605
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,700
Well, have a safe journey home

606
00:57:13,702 --> 00:57:15,456
Nice to see you again, have a seat!

607
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:16,431
Thank you

608
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,463
Have you heard something of Tetsuo?

609
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,100
Tetsuo?

610
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,500
Ah, the one who inquired several
times regarding his invention...

611
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Actually, we haven't seen him for a while...

612
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,900
Are your sure?

613
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,200
Yes, what are you concerned about?

614
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,500
The day my brother and Glen
departed to Planet X he wanted

615
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,660
to meet you and hasn't come back yet...

616
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Hey, how long gonna keeping me here?

617
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,500
You will understand soon...

618
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,100
What will I understand?!

619
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,200
We will change the future of Earth

620
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,700
Changing the future?

621
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,800
The commander wants your attendance

622
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,900
Yes!

623
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,900
Hey, wait!

624
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,200
Hey, hey, who is the commander?!

625
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,700
This is Earth control

626
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,500
Commander speaking

627
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,700
Your orders, please!

628
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,800
Schedule #5 - Plan #2 - Items #4

629
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,500
Confirming!
Schedule #5 - Plan #2 - Items #4

630
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,100
Affirm!

631
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,800
P-1 on landing procedure

632
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,900
Put it on the monitor!

633
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,806
The gentlemen have arrived

634
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,479
Welcome home, you've got something for us...

635
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,200
This tape contains the data for the cancer cure

636
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,700
Maybe the device is broken?

637
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,900
I don't think so...

638
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,567
Their audio records maybe taped different?

639
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:45,900
According to them, it should be

640
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:54,200
I am the commander of Planet X

641
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,400
People of the Earth, take my orders!

642
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,300
Earth will become a colony of Planet X

643
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,174
Disobedience will not be accepted,
otherwise every human shall be destroyed

644
01:00:14,374 --> 01:00:17,300
You have 24 hours to subordinate!

645
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,200
Double-crossed bastards...

646
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,100
Scumbags!

647
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,700
We expect you to comply to our rules

648
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,100
entirely and without any setbacks!

649
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,600
"This horrifying broadcast"

650
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,700
"caused uproars around the world"

651
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,100
"Some wanted to accept for the
sake of peace"

652
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,100
"but the majority wanted to fight"

653
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,100
"Even violence erupted between
those two fractions"

654
01:01:17,644 --> 01:01:19,300
Glen...

655
01:01:22,661 --> 01:01:24,567
Things getting clearer now...

656
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,687
Yes, I am a citizen of Planet-X and
you probably confused because you saw

657
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,100
my female look alikes on Planet X

658
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:32,600
Go on, Namikawa

659
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:33,900
Glen,

660
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,100
I was bound to my commander's instructions!

661
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Including an arranged marriage?

662
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,900
No!

663
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,500
Glen, believe me!

664
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
You mean more to me than anything!

665
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:51,900
Well, then take this uniform off
and get out us out the place!

666
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:58,689
I can't, they all will perish here,
we both can only survive on Planet X!

667
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:04,400
Look Namikawa, how can we live there?
We are no emotionless robots!

668
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,600
what value has love if supervised?

669
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,200
We will fight for our freedom
despite all possible human losses

670
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,300
Your conscience, controlled by a computer?

671
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:20,700
Namikawa, if you ever loved me -
is there a way of avoiding this war?

672
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,600
You better let me know, now!

673
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,200
Think, not only ours, all joy
in this world will be doomed!

674
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,309
It's this world which created love in you

675
01:02:26,557 --> 01:02:30,800
Glen, it's not only beyond my limits

676
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,544
it's too late either...

677
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,976
Are you concealing anything?!

678
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,700
Glen...

679
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,700
It's indeed too late!

680
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,400
You breached our conducts and

681
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,900
I'll take you under arrest!

682
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,600
Glen...

683
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,100
Glen!

684
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,500
Run, they gonna torture you!

685
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,200
Glen!

686
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,400
What have you done?

687
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,100
You are this planet's scum!

688
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,500
We only rely on calculations

689
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,400
and not on emotions!

690
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,400
Whatever brakes the law has
to be destroyed!

691
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,300
Fuji!

692
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,100
W.S.A reports several objects approaching

693
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,300
What is that?

694
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,900
King Gidorah seems to be one of it

695
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,200
Any good news?

696
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,300
Not really, the politicians are

697
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,700
still considering whereas

698
01:04:06,701 --> 01:04:08,566
the armed forces urging for using
all sorts of nuclear weapons

699
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:11,179
The radioactive fall out will make
all life impossible, eventually!

700
01:04:11,669 --> 01:04:15,100
The usual out of the frying pan 
into the fire stuff...

701
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,400
Fuji...?

702
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,300
Did you speak to Glen?

703
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,800
I couldn't find him anywhere!

704
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,200
For heaven's sake, where is he?

705
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,800
They coming, they coming!

706
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:05,600
Until now you have not complied
with the orders of Planet X

707
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,800
As you may have noticed we already

708
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,900
made preparations to conquer Earth

709
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,800
We will be supported by King Ghidorah!

710
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,100
All the time Ghidorah was their weapon!

711
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:24,700
King Ghidorah, Godzilla and Rodan

712
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,600
are under our Alpha wave control

713
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,700
Damn!

714
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,700
Subordinate until tomorrow or

715
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:46,100
mankind will be annihilated...

716
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,300
No chances left then

717
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,200
Allegedly they tame the monster
through Alpha waves...

718
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,800
Yes, is that significant?

719
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,600
We made some experiments a while ago, here...

720
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,700
'Using Alpha waves in practise', incredible!

721
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:17,900
Indeed!

722
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,500
What, not you again...

723
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
So it looks like...

724
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,600
A nice location for a meeting!

725
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,700
Indeed, a weird place...

726
01:06:31,566 --> 01:06:35,100
Pointless, already checked each cell square

727
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:38,097
No hatch to escape...

728
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:44,168
Soundproofed?!

729
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,200
The walls are soundproof so are

730
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,811
the bars and the entire rest

731
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:02,900
New orders do apply

732
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,429
Humankind is destined

733
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:10,575
to become extinct in 20 hours!

734
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,900
No prisoners!

735
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:20,704
Fifteen hours left, suggestions?

736
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:24,823
The only chance is using
our entire nuclear power!

737
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,400
Maybe it's time for worshipping?

738
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,411
I can't see how prayers can help us

739
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,200
At least our souls will be save...

740
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:36,300
With due respect, options left are

741
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,343
Fight or doom!

742
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,848
Wait a minute!

743
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,038
The is one other chance, but
we need some more time

744
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,016
What are you talking about?

745
01:07:44,285 --> 01:07:48,200
They use Alpha waves to
control the monster

746
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,500
That's where they maybe vulnerable

747
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,600
If we stop or interfere their waves

748
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,663
we will save the earth!

749
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:57,100
This is not the time for experiments!

750
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:58,522
Except final test procedures

751
01:07:58,978 --> 01:08:01,400
our device will be in working in time!

752
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,400
Alright, that looks convincing

753
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,300
Any problems within the A-cycle?

754
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,100
This way please

755
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,400
Fuji! Yes?

756
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,100
How is it going on?

757
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,800
Well it seems working well but

758
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,900
We don't have much time left

759
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,200
I know, I know

760
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,800
Well, what are we on now?

761
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,900
At the moment, this tape recorder

762
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,237
is powered by magnetic waves
from these two devices

763
01:08:33,237 --> 01:08:34,812
Haron, please turn it off
Okay

764
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:38,700
Switch it on again!
Okay

765
01:08:41,494 --> 01:08:46,900
We need to interfere their signal
prior the monster receiving them

766
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:55,100
Like a lead plate can block waves

767
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:00,035
we developed a mobile transducer

768
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:01,731
interfering and cutting of waves

769
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,900
on intersection their direction

770
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:26,678
Are you sure it will work?

771
01:09:27,175 --> 01:09:29,552
Yes, although we do not know

772
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:32,344
which frequency the enemy uses

773
01:09:32,561 --> 01:09:35,100
to control Godzilla and Rodan

774
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,100
So we should transmit on all

775
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,400
possible frequencies at once

776
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:46,304
What, if they use a frequency
beyond our bandwidth?

777
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:53,215
Well, lets cross fingers
that won't be the case...

778
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:03,456
10 hours left!

779
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:06,500
All earth units on standby!

780
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,600
Earth control, report!

781
01:10:10,612 --> 01:10:13,500
All tasks accomplished!

782
01:10:14,139 --> 01:10:15,893
Its so quiet here

783
01:10:15,973 --> 01:10:17,262
aah...

784
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,251
Give it up, there is no way out!

785
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,153
Glen, seems to be yours...

786
01:10:38,153 --> 01:10:39,593
What's it?

787
01:10:39,929 --> 01:10:42,113
This is a letter from Namikawa!

788
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:44,300
Offering you a 'contract' either?

789
01:10:44,863 --> 01:10:46,073
Read...

790
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:50,200
"Glen, by the time you read this"

791
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,323
"I have perished for having emotions"

792
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,492
"But I have no regrets!"

793
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:01,400
"Through you I found love beyond
all these circuit boards"

794
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,956
"Get in contact with Tetsuo Toori,
he invented a strong weapon"

795
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:09,997
"This distorted noise, unbearable
not only for earthlings"

796
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:12,380
"Farewell, Glen!"

797
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:16,439
Hang on, that's why this cell is soundproofed!

798
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,440
Yeah...

799
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:20,964
And that's why my invention was suppressed!

800
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,383
That thing creates such a sound?

801
01:11:33,383 --> 01:11:33,942
Yeah!

802
01:11:33,942 --> 01:11:35,839
Actually, it can drive you nuts!

803
01:11:35,873 --> 01:11:37,466
Listen to this...

804
01:11:42,872 --> 01:11:43,867
Ah, stop it, stop it!

805
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,682
It works, it works!

806
01:11:51,157 --> 01:11:53,014
Hurry, get the keys!

807
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:53,982
Okay!

808
01:12:34,327 --> 01:12:35,463
That way to the lake!

809
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,419
Commander!

810
01:12:43,611 --> 01:12:44,245
What's up?

811
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:45,919
The prisoners have escaped!

812
01:12:46,176 --> 01:12:46,928
What?!

813
01:12:55,057 --> 01:12:55,698
All stations...

814
01:12:55,698 --> 01:12:58,941
Red alert!
The prisoners have escaped!

815
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:34,446
Mission accomplished, return to base!

816
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,855
That was close

817
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:44,301
Yeah, but they may soon

818
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,370
investigate the remains!

819
01:13:45,561 --> 01:13:47,939
So where are we heading now?

820
01:13:48,835 --> 01:13:52,120
Don't wait for a ferry, swim!

821
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,880
5 hours to go

822
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,387
Everything as scheduled

823
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:12,803
Affirm

824
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:15,340
Brother, look...

825
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:16,197
Ya...

826
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:17,962
Hi, we are back...

827
01:14:17,962 --> 01:14:19,990
Glen, where have you been?!

828
01:14:20,218 --> 01:14:23,321
Look at this, the A-cycle light ray

829
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:28,287
This device will intercept their waves!

830
01:14:28,345 --> 01:14:29,442
Aah...

831
01:14:29,443 --> 01:14:31,636
Eh..., what are you doing here?

832
01:14:31,636 --> 01:14:33,095
No reason to be rude...

833
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:36,800
Listen, only his invention will save us!

834
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,863
Eh...?

835
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:42,629
His miniature sound transmitter
will cause vital physical harm!

836
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:43,486
Are you serious...?

837
01:14:43,486 --> 01:14:45,926
We owe our lives its existence!

838
01:14:45,926 --> 01:14:48,800
Simply amplify and broadcast
this sound via ordinary radios

839
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,376
making it for the aliens
inevitable to hear it!

840
01:14:51,568 --> 01:14:53,530
Well, then lets try it

841
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,706
No time to loose, only 3 hours left!

842
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,100
Okay!

843
01:14:59,932 --> 01:15:00,813
Commander!

844
01:15:00,813 --> 01:15:02,791
Our computer analysed a danger!

845
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,082
Computer?

846
01:15:05,331 --> 01:15:07,821
Calculations are running!

847
01:15:07,854 --> 01:15:09,343
Unknown error!

848
01:15:10,888 --> 01:15:11,551
Affirm

849
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,999
In this case, new orders do apply

850
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,866
Offense against Earth starts now!

851
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:19,810
Increasing likelihoods?

852
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:22,931
No, rather adverse!

853
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,292
Attention!

854
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,766
Monster One and Monster Two

855
01:15:27,151 --> 01:15:28,511
to be released!

856
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,549
Professor, the aliens started
their offensive prematurely!

857
01:16:28,644 --> 01:16:29,060
Eh...?

858
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,348
They probably became aware...

859
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:33,213
of our new weapon...

860
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,269
Go on, support Glen and Tetsuo!

861
01:16:34,484 --> 01:16:34,988
Yes!

862
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,200
Calculations still running...

863
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:12,976
Affirm

864
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:15,056
All units get ready!

865
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,490
Clear for attack!

866
01:17:28,453 --> 01:17:31,400
Fallback, all withdrawing!

867
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,597
Revaluations successful!

868
01:18:42,099 --> 01:18:42,894
Mmh...

869
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,206
We need to destroy all their
machinery and equipment

870
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:49,703
Mmh...?

871
01:18:54,126 --> 01:18:55,039
Brother...

872
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:55,695
Ya...

873
01:18:55,951 --> 01:18:57,614
Glen, how far are you?!

874
01:18:57,878 --> 01:19:00,929
Severe losses of artillery trucks!

875
01:19:00,929 --> 01:19:02,643
Don't have better news...

876
01:19:02,688 --> 01:19:05,768
We are in the final stages
of the broadcast procedures

877
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,919
Good, Earth's fate depends on that!

878
01:19:08,919 --> 01:19:09,664
Okay!

879
01:19:12,288 --> 01:19:13,217
Let's continue...

880
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:13,849
Okay!

881
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,313
Error reports?

882
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,161
Negative!

883
01:19:29,902 --> 01:19:32,080
Monster Zero clear for attack!

884
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:35,098
This way! This way!

885
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,886
Some men should stay in the tunnel

886
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:43,598
Second division, hold your position!

887
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:45,181
Further orders to follow!

888
01:19:45,357 --> 01:19:46,430
Roger! Roger!

889
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,374
Please use this device...

890
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,127
Thank you!

891
01:23:43,071 --> 01:23:45,984
Attention, this is an emergency broadcast!

892
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:50,790
Subsequently to this announcement
a distorted sound will be aired

893
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:57,537
This is an intentional broadcast,
your cooperation is highly required

894
01:23:57,537 --> 01:24:00,738
Do not switch off but turn up
to the highest volume levels!

895
01:24:11,195 --> 01:24:12,763
Professor, its on the air!

896
01:24:13,386 --> 01:24:14,409
Time for you striking!

897
01:24:14,409 --> 01:24:15,484
Offense position!
Yes!

898
01:24:15,706 --> 01:24:17,123
Offense position!

899
01:24:17,308 --> 01:24:19,671
Our next target will be their base at the lake...

900
01:24:19,863 --> 01:24:20,427
Okay

901
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:27,209
"Attention please, this aired
sound is fully on purpose!"

902
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:32,785
"It is absolutely vital that it
can be heard in all areas, so"

903
01:24:32,785 --> 01:24:37,050
"do not switch off your radio
but turn the volume up!"

904
01:24:42,689 --> 01:24:43,625
Danger!

905
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:44,754
Impossible!

906
01:25:08,077 --> 01:25:08,870
Time to attack!

907
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:09,406
Yes!

908
01:25:09,576 --> 01:25:10,952
Attack, attack!

909
01:25:11,137 --> 01:25:11,770
Forward!

910
01:25:51,831 --> 01:25:52,542
Any new observing?

911
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,400
Unaltered situation...

912
01:25:59,972 --> 01:26:01,463
Look, there is one of their ships!

913
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:10,545
Time for frequency interference

914
01:26:10,736 --> 01:26:12,466
Affirm, start intersection!

915
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:13,056
Yes!

916
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:14,633
Ignition!

917
01:26:23,223 --> 01:26:25,910
We need new calculations!
Commander...

918
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:27,393
Commander?

919
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,984
Commander?
Commander?

920
01:26:38,856 --> 01:26:41,607
Emergency, Emergency!

921
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:45,174
Stop this horrid sound!
Stop this horrid sound!

922
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:28,168
Time for our A-cycle block

923
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,074
Okay, start intersection!

924
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:32,600
Artillery units, ignition!

925
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,837
Professor, it works!

926
01:28:37,094 --> 01:28:37,799
Commander!

927
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,629
Error report!

928
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:41,645
We lost control of both monster!

929
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:42,740
I'll do it...!

930
01:29:04,592 --> 01:29:07,583
What's going on down there?
Earth control?!...

931
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:08,744
Earth control...!?

932
01:29:09,864 --> 01:29:11,656
Commander!

933
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:17,432
Commander!

934
01:29:17,492 --> 01:29:19,467
Retreat, we are doomed!

935
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:22,400
No, computers don't fail!

936
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,138
We need new calculations, now!

937
01:29:24,307 --> 01:29:27,594
Total annihilation!
Evacuate!

938
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:28,595
Evacuate...!

939
01:29:50,494 --> 01:29:51,407
Look, their ship caught fire!

940
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:52,248
Yeah...

941
01:30:04,889 --> 01:30:06,587
Earth control!

942
01:30:06,616 --> 01:30:08,387
Retreat, we have failed!

943
01:30:09,649 --> 01:30:11,907
What fails has to be destroyed!

944
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:16,915
We will be revenged one day, though!

945
01:30:24,576 --> 01:30:25,616
We made it!

946
01:30:26,215 --> 01:30:27,240
Yeah!

947
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,344
Let's go!

948
01:32:25,519 --> 01:32:26,008
Yes!

949
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:27,691
Retraction!

950
01:33:11,266 --> 01:33:11,989
What's up?

951
01:33:12,164 --> 01:33:13,103
Have a look there!

952
01:33:13,104 --> 01:33:13,815
Ah...

953
01:33:39,778 --> 01:33:41,573
Godzilla and Rodan, dead...?

954
01:33:41,764 --> 01:33:44,319
No, rather unlikely...

955
01:33:45,612 --> 01:33:47,373
Look Fuji, any objections?

956
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:48,311
Mmh...

957
01:33:49,655 --> 01:33:50,832
I surrender...

958
01:33:51,496 --> 01:33:52,875
And we deserve a holiday!

959
01:33:53,779 --> 01:33:54,536
Not you!

960
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:55,136
Ah?

961
01:33:55,535 --> 01:33:57,681
You have to fly to Planet X again!

962
01:33:57,911 --> 01:33:59,128
Sorry...?

963
01:33:59,287 --> 01:34:01,401
It's still needs to be further explored!

964
01:34:02,379 --> 01:34:04,075
This is a reward that

965
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:07,700
keeps you grounded...

966
01:34:19,428 --> 01:34:25,100
END
