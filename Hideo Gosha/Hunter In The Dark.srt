controlled by bribery and corruption,

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,840
The general corruption
and resulting lawlessness

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Spawned fearful secret organizations,

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,600

32
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880

RIVERSIDE TEAHOUSE KEMESEN
GOMYO'S DEN

34
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,560
Good morning.
- Good morning,

35
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,440
The red Camellias are lovely aren't they?
- Yes they are,

36
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Please take these.
- Thank you,

37
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,640
Good morning.
- Good morning,

38
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,160
Take this to the inner room.
- OK,

39
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,440
Is that so?

40
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Such a unique sword style.
I'm told you are an excellent swordsman.

41
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,880
Not at all. I'm just a novice.

42
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,040
Sorry Boss, but it's late.

43
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm afraid I can't give you much.

44
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
You should have let me know.

45
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,880
Not at all. I was hungry.

46
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,200
The food was fine.
Right Tanigawa-san?

47
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,080
Yes, it was fine.

48
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,440
Her name is Omon.

49
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
She runs this teahouse.

50
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,920
Sometimes she carries our messages.

51
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,800
My name is Tanigawa Yataro.
I'm glad to meet you.

52
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,080
Tanigawa-san is going to work for me.

53
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,880
He's a friend of mine and 
he is exceptionally reliable.

54
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,680
I have total confidence in him.
Please take care of him.

55
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,520
Arrange it so he can rest until evening.

56
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Certainly, i'll do my best,
Tanigawa-san.

57
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,320
You understand, Tanigawa-san?

58
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,720
I trust you'll perform your
services well for me.

59
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,760
Still the same old picture.

60
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
How does the boss seem?

61
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,880
Seems he likes him.

62
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Is that so?

63
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,1000
Now that Tokuzo of
Shirogane was gotten rid of,

64
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,880
From now on it'll be either
our boss or Jihei of Shiba.

65
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,680
It'll be settled this evening.

66
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,880
I wish I could see how it's hand led.

67
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
Don't treat it lightly.

68
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,200
Tanigawa-san.

69
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,240
It's about time we got going.

70
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,480
Omon.

71
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Omon.

72
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,840
Are you sure it's all right?

73
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
We can't turn back.

74
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,320
That's right.

75
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,080
The die is cast.

76
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,680
But, just in case...

77
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
There's no way we can fail.

78
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,680
Jihei, of Shiba,

79
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,400
Never puts himself in jeopardy.

80
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,080
He'll tactfully lure out
our boss Gomyo.

81
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,840
and he'll be stabbed.

82
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
He'll never return alive.

83
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,440
But, that Ronin...

84
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,280
Can we really trust him?

85
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
That one?

86
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
He won't fail us, there's no doubt.

87
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,320
That Ronin ...

88
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,280
I saved his life.

89
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Gomyo.

90
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
Welcome, Boss of Shiba.

91
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I’ve      brought only
One aide, as agreed.

92
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,520
and also, I'm unarmed.

93
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,640
I trust you in that respect.

94
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,040
We're here to discuss who will be
the new boss of the underworld in Edo.

95
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
She is enough as my aide.

96
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,400
But what about you, Gomyo?

97
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,040
You're with a samurai.
You're Very careful.

98
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,200
Don't be difficult.

99
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,1000
If we can settle it by a
Discussion, it'll be best.

100
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,880
You sound peaceful, but...

101
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,200
Last night at Omodaka bridge...

102
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,680
I hear Boss Tokuzo
was assassinated there.

103
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,120
What about it?

104
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,480
One of the three
biggest bosses was killed.

105
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,640
It makes it convenient for us.

106
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,480
Are you sure your weren't
behind the scenes on that?

107
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,320
Boss, I hope you haven't grown
stupid because of your mistress.

108
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
Whoever may have been behind it

109
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,520
It's one of our basic rules
not to make an issue of it.

110
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,480
You better educate her.

111
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,040
You're absolutely right.

112
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,800
Well then, let's come straight
to the main point.

113
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,440
Gomyo...

114
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,520
You're too good natured.

115
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,680
How did you ever get to be
an underworld boss?

116
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Listen.

117
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,720
Yaichi, your underling who
arranged this meeting,

118
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,760
Fell in love with omon
and betrayed you to us.

119
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
What do you think about that?

120
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,920
Well, Boss Gomyo?

121
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,080
Shut up!

122
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,520
Hurry and kill me!

123
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,320
Well said!

124
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,800
According to your wish, we'll kill you.

125
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,240
Kill him.

126
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,680
You...

127
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,640
Damn it!

128
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,560
REVOLVING LANTERN SHOP
GOMYO'S DEN

129
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Welcome back.

130
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
What are you doing?

131
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,640
This is absolutely unforgivable.

132
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,320
Are you making a fool of me

133
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,360
Just because the boss isn't here?

134
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,920
Sakimatsu. What's all this about?
explain all this.

135
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,280
What are you all up to?

136
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,720
- Will you be quiet for a while?

137
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Yaichi.

138
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,560
- What is it?

139
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,120
You said the boss isn't here.

140
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,800
Where is he and what's he doing?

141
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,400
Will you tell us?

142
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
Will I tell you?

143
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
What's wrong?

144
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,320
Very well.
I will tell you the story.

145
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
The boss, he isn't alive anymore.

146
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,440
What's worse...

147
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,920
Jihei's men will be here soon
to  shut you all up permanently.

148
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,360
So that's how it'll be.

149
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,440
Then are you the one
who betrayed our boss to Jihei?

150
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,600
We'll talk about it later.

151
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,760
If your want to live, join me.

152
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,080
You better hurry, or...

153
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,240
- What if I say I want to live, too?

154
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,400
Boss!

155
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,160
According to the
rules of the underworld

156
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,320
We must stab the betrayer
with a dagger until he is dead.

157
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,360
What about her?

158
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,800
I never thought you'd betray me.

159
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I don't care.

160
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,1000
Kill me if you like.

161
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,520
It's my fault.

162
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,120
If you kill me.
I'll have no regrets.

163
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,480
You left me for that woman
who tried to commit suicide.

164
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,800
I felt like I was thrown
into the depths of hell.

165
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,040
Boss...
Let's observe the rule.

166
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,160
That picture again?

167
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,960
Sometimes you can be so childish.

168
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,040
Always the same picture.

169
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,320
But we are going there one day,
aren't we?

170
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,480
We'll go there together, won't we?

171
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,160
Yes, someday.

172
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
If you want to go that badly.

173
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,720
It's strange.

174
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,120
As you so often asked me to go,

175
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,800
I began to feel as though
I'd been there too.

176
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,680
Boss...

177
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Kill me at once!

178
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
Please kill me!

179
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
Boss!

180
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,840
You chose to live in the underworld.
No one forced you.

181
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
So don't complain now.

182
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,040
I fell for a woman I shouldn't love.

183
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,400
I'm to blame. It's my fate.

184
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,200
I’ve      no grudge against the boss.

185
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,400
I’ve nothing personal against him.

186
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,280
So as the rule says, kill me!

187
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,520
I wish I could ask
him to forgive you.

188
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,160
But you tried to kill him,
and that's unforgivable.

189
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,200
Omon...

190
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Boss...

191
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,440
What's wrong?

192
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,400
You look so stern.

193
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,840
I was lonely.

194
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,520
Yesterday... Today...

195
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,640
So very lonely.

196
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
Don't say that.

197
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Don't say you're lonely.

198
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,600
I love you. Boss.

199
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
I'm floating.

200
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm floating.

201
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
My body is floating.

202
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,640
Is this where I'm to die?

203
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,920
Omon.

204
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,440
It's our rule to kill woman
without bloodshed.

205
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,120
Because of that, you'll drown.

206
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,800
- Wait a minute!

207
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,200
We'Ve been friends a
long time haven't we?

208
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,840
Let me at least prepare myself.

209
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,240
Omon.

210
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,1000
What are you doing?

211
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,880
Stop it!

212
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,080
I'm the infamous Madame of Kamesen
and I'm going to die.

213
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,760
I want to be neat when I die.

214
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,400
Don't underestimate me.

215
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,640
I'm different from Yaichi.

216
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,280
You misunderstand .

217
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,560
You're very suspicious, aren't you?

218
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,880
Look. Now I have no
weapons whatsoever.

219
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,120
Now, search me.

220
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,800
Don't do it.

221
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,280
Omon, you mustn't.

222
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,120
You want me, don't you?

223
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,840
You can hold me if you like.

224
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm going to die soon anyway.

225
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,800
What are you doing?!

226
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,840
PUBLIC BATH
GOMYO'S DEN

227
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,560
Will you hurry?
Please hurry, will you?

228
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,680
We're closing for the day.

229
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Welcome Inspector Chosuke.

230
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm going to soak in
The bath for some time.

231
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,120
I'm sorry.
We are closing early today.

232
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,760
Please forgive me.

233
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,280
He likes the water hot, understand ?

234
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,280
Inspector...

235
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,400
I'm with the police,
yet you dare to say no to me?

236
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,080
No, sir. Sorry, sir.

237
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,920
"offerings of money work so well. "

238
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
I see.

239
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,280
"The children of officials soon
learn how to tickle people's palms. "

240
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,120
"The children of officials soon
learn how to tickle people's palms. "

241
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,760
"The children of officials soon
learn how to tickle people's palms. "

242
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,160
Good, excellent wording!

243
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,400
Nowadays, officials won't do a thing
unless they're bribed.

244
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,400
Is that what this means?

245
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,520
Good wording.
It couldn't be better.

246
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,520
I really mean it.

247
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,040
You're making fool of me!

248
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,400
That I won't forgive!

249
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,840
Out of my way!

250
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,920
Why you...!

251
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
- Wait, inspector.

252
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,400
- What?

253
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,200
- He's upstairs.

254
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,880
What? Upstairs?
Boss Gomyo's upstairs?

255
00:34:49,1000 --> 00:34:54,640
A comic song goes...
"Tanuma is absolutely beyond me"

256
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,840
"But a Shogun, at least,
I wish I could be,"

257
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,440
Minister Tanuma's political power
exceeded even that of the Shogun,

258
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,200
The mansion of Tanuma,
The Prime Minister,

259
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,600
was always filled with visitors,
who brought him bribes,

260
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,320
It appears you deeply regret
having missed being assigned

261
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,800
to  oversee the Ezo district.

262
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,120
That is correct, Sire.

263
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,040
The Kitamae Clan has been abolished.
The procedures are over.

264
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,960
Therefore, I believe you
no longer need me.

265
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,800
I know that.
Don't try to be sarcastic.

266
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,360
I already assigned that position
to  Kazue Ishikawa because

267
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,920
I heard there was a plot
to revive the Kitamae clan.

268
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,600
I know, Sire.

269
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,600
I hardly think those
country samurai can do much.

270
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,920
But if they ever get
a wind of what we're doing

271
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,160
not only you, buy I as well,
Will be in trouble.

272
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,160
I don't think you have
much to worry about.

273
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,320
Still, it's wise to be cautious.

274
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,480
It's because I'm always
careful in whatever I do,

275
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,360
That I’ve enjoyed political might
for more than ten full years.

276
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,040
Until the rioting Kitamae Clan
Ronin are liquidated,

277
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:03,400
I order you to continue overseeing
the city of Edo from the shadows.

278
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
When all threats are removed,

279
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,680
I shall then appoint
you to govern Ezo.

280
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,360
Seems he is concerned about us.

281
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,680
Because the boss ordered
him to take care of me.

282
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,880
Don't you mind me staying here?

283
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
The boss wouldn't object.

284
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,760
You really don't remember your past?

285
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,480
Nothing at all?

286
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,520
not a thing.

287
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,680
It's better that you don't remember.

288
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,520
Why?

289
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,680
I'm scared about
you recalling your past.

290
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Even if I could remember,

291
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
I'd never change.

292
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,320
Then...

293
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,040
Then you...

294
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,640
What?

295
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,480
If you stay with the boss too long

296
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
Something terrible will surely
happen one day.

297
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,600
So, we still have
Seven more remaining.

298
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,560
They are trying to
act against Lord Tanuma.

299
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,360
They're good swordsmen.
They're very smart, too.

300
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,520
Please don't say any more.

301
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:57,920
We never ask our clients
Why we must kill.

302
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
That's one of the rules
of the underworld.

303
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,400
No matter what
other bosses might do.

304
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,440
I took the liberty of
having you checked out.

305
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,400
Shimoguni-sama,

306
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,400
You were the chamberlain
of the Kitamae Clan of Ezo,

307
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,680
Which was abolished
a few years ago.

308
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,840
You pulled the strings
behind it's abolishment.

309
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:40,040
Since then,
you've worked for Tanuma.

310
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,280
You're asking me to get rid
of those Kitamae Ronin        

311
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,800
Who are plotting to revive the clan.
Right?

312
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,040
Then, let me ask this:

313
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,920
What do you think of Kakizaki,
the one who's their leader?

314
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,240
I know he's all talk and no action.

315
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,120
All he has is his name and 
his lineage. He's incompetent.

316
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,880
and I'm a traitor.

317
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,440
I arranged it so my
own clan would be abolished.

318
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,640
But Gomyo...

319
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,120
I was able to stand back and 
watch my own clan being destroyed.

320
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,960
Because I felt it was already
caught up in the current of the times.

321
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,000
No one could stop it.
when I saw no future for the clan,

322
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,680
I decided to aband on it.

323
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,440
Instead, I had a beautiful dream

324
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,120
About the vast land of Ezo.

325
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,920
Ezo?

326
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,440
That's right, Ezo.

327
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,080
I want to develop the land of Ezo
with   my very own hand s.

328
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,040
That vast land ...

329
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,480
Countless wild horses...

330
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,400
Enormous amounts of fish...

331
00:42:39,1000 --> 00:42:42,560
Many lakes with wild birds...

332
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,520
It's not just a dream.

333
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,240
not just a dream.

334
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,320
When my present job is over

335
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,240
I'll become governor of Ezo.

336
00:43:04,1000 --> 00:43:05,680
But...

337
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,960
Why must you always
stay in the shadows?

338
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,720
Why is it you don't come
out into the daylight?

339
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,560
You, a commoner, and I, a samurai
can make big plans for Ezo together.

340
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,400
It can be anot her way of life.

341
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,920
I mentioned this so abruptly.

342
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,760
We have a long way to go.

343
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,520
We have time to think.

344
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,120
It's been such a long time.

345
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,800
You're always working hard.

346
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,280
You're sexy.

347
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,440
That's terrific!

348
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
This is bad.

349
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,160
They're almost burning.

350
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,320
They're cooked too much,
but bear with me.

351
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,040
What's wrong?

352
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,200
Don't worry about the police anymore.

353
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,640
How's this?

354
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,880
Don't be so sulky.

355
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,400
I'm the reason that you're safe.

356
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,760
Besides...

357
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,360
Your body already belongs to me.

358
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,440
I have good reason, huh?

359
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,440
I'll never get a woman like you again.

360
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,120
I'll never let you go.
Absolutely not .

361
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
Do as you wish.

362
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,640
It's like...

363
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,120
It's like I'm already dead.

364
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,320
Stop it!

365
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,280
Forget about the
organization and the boss.

366
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,520
I'll make you forget.

367
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,960
Do it this evening.

368
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,840
This is from the boss.
It's your advance.

369
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,160
Who am I to kill?

370
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,200
All the ones we're after.

371
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,280
It'll be a close game.

372
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,680
I mean, it'll be
a life-or-death match.

373
00:46:24,1000 --> 00:46:28,600
I can easily hand le two or three.

374
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,560
But not six or seven.

375
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
Then...

376
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,160
Sukegoro-san, will you help
with   the preparations?

377
00:46:40,1000 --> 00:46:42,080
Of course.

378
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,840
and will you do me anot her favour?

379
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,160
If I fail to return,

380
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,160
Will you give the money to Osaki?

381
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,440
Yes. I'll do as you request.

382
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,240
Thank you.

383
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,440
We aren't well informed about Edo.

384
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,120
If we stay like this,
we'll all be killed before long.

385
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
That's the point.

386
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,720
We overlooked a prime new hideout.

387
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,640
Lord Kitamae's family temple...
Hannyain Temple.

388
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,480
It's in Asakusa.

389
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,720
It's practically in ruins.

390
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,480
But it'll make a good hideout.

391
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,400
Rather than finding a hideout,

392
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,840
Why don't we plan a counterattack?

393
00:48:02,1000 --> 00:48:04,760
- Don't underestimate them.

394
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,520
They're very strong.

395
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,160
Then, what kind of plan do you have?

396
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,800
Plan? Plan to do what?

397
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,680
To  revive the Kitamae Clan.

398
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,480
- There's no possibility of that.

399
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,440
No possibility?

400
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,320
Sire! Why isn't there?

401
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,160
Listen. We don't even know
where the young successor is.

402
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,360
- Then what have
we been working for?

403
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,520
In order to approach Lord Tanuma,
so that he'll allow us to revive the Clan.

404
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,720
Is that understood?

405
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,640
Plots always fail in
some small way or anot her.

406
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,120
In our case

407
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,080
They left the little lord alive.

408
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,680
Why are you grinning?

409
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,680
You'll get to sleep with the
woman you love this evening.

410
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,240
I envy you.

411
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

412
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,040
You're pretty clever, huh?

413
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,640
Welcome.

414
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,320
Give me saké.

415
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,440
Here you are.

416
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,920
Isn't she waiting for you?

417
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,720
It's cold out.
I want one more hot saké.

418
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,920
Heizaburo!

419
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,640
Sasao Heizaburo!

420
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,240
Damn you!

421
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,000
Heizaburo! I'm Sugioka, your friend!

422
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,680
Omon.

423
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,800
Well? Want some, too?

424
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,920
Help yourself.

425
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,120
I think...

426
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,840
I still have a chance.

427
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,280
Something good
will happen to me soon.

428
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,600
I can't stay in dire poverty forever.

429
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,920
Look...
If we get some money,

430
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,240
Let's move to osaka.

431
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,000
Let's get a fresh start there.

432
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,440
How's that?
Try to understand how I feel.

433
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,880
Don't betray me.

434
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,120
If you betray me...

435
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,480
Boss...

436
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,480
That man...

437
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,560
I hope your not in love with him.

438
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,840
No way.

439
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,120
Recently...

440
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,600
You've become very sexy,
haven't you?

441
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,360
Yes. He may have pleased you.

442
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,1000
But don't fall for him.

443
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,080
You know what, huh?

444
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:06,200
Jihei sent you here
to  spy on Gomyo and his men.

445
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,920
It's starting to work now.

446
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,320
Yet...

447
00:59:11,1000 --> 00:59:15,680
Oren, please trust me.

448
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,400
I'll lure him out
as soon as there's news.

449
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,760
That's good.

450
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,880
Then Jihei, who was killed by him,
will be able to rest in peace.

451
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:35,720
I'll get revenge on him,

452
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,200
Even after i've turned to ashes.

453
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,920
As long as you remember the
rules of the underworld,

454
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,1000
It'll be all right.

455
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,120
Won't it, osaki?

456
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,920
You're all right?

457
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,760
Thank goodness.

458
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,080
Undo my sash.

459
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,720
Yes.

460
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640
You'll get dirty.

461
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,120
Put it on the counter.
I'll get rid of it later.

462
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,520
Yes.

463
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,520
For Osaki from Tanigawa-san.

464
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,640
Osaki.

465
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,560
Kill him! Kill him now!

466
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,680
Yataro-san!

467
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,040
Get him! Kill him!

468
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,560
Get him! Kill him!

469
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,360
Osaki!

470
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,040
Osaki!

471
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,480
Osaki!

472
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,880
You bitch!

473
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,080
Damn it!

474
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,720
Tanigawa-san,
get a hold of yourself.

475
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,520
Now, Tanigawa-san!

476
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:05,960
Hang in there!

477
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:22,160
REVOLVING LANTERN SHOP
GOMYO'S DEN

478
01:08:23,1000 --> 01:08:24,1000
He needs a doctor.

479
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,480
What do you suggest?

480
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,240
The boss is out. What'll we do?

481
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,360
Tanigawa-san...

482
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,080
You all right? Get a doctor.

483
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,320
No! I don't need a doctor.

484
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,960
It'll cause the boss trouble.

485
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,120
Tanigawa-san!
- Tanigawa-san!

486
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,480
- I'll take care of him.

487
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,560
Sorry for the inconvenience.

488
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,920
Are you all right?

489
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,520
You have other matters
that need taking care of.

490
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,640
Yeah, we have to cover it up.

491
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,840
Sadahachi.
- Yes,

492
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,480
Then, will you please see to this?

493
01:10:02,1000 --> 01:10:04,160
Be careful.

494
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,320
Sorry...

495
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,400
Who are you?

496
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,320
I haven't introduced myself.

497
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,640
My name is Tanigawa Yataro.

498
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Tanigawa-san?

499
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,920
Thanks a lot.

500
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,720
You saved him.

501
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,480
Not at all.

502
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,560
How's your wound?

503
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,640
I wasn't careful enough.

504
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,720
I'm sorry.

505
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,240
I'm the one to apologize.

506
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,640
Try to get well first.
Hey, Oriwa...

507
01:11:24,1000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yes!

508
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,400
Some cotton cloth...

509
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,920
I'll do it.

510
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,960
No. Never mind.

511
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,360
Sir, it's been a long time.

512
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,160
I used to work for you.

513
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,320
I have something to tell you.

514
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,200
Your name is Kasuke. Is that right?

515
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,600
Yes. It's been a while.

516
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,600
So, what is it you want to tell me?

517
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,640
Do you know a samurai
named Sasao Heizaburo?

518
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,400
Sasao Heizaburo?

519
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,520
He tried to kill you

520
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,800
But killed his father by mistake.

521
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,280
There was a massacre
at Esashiya Inn last night.

522
01:12:43,1000 --> 01:12:46,440
He did it. and also...

523
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:58,880
More and more Kitamae Ronin        
are being assassinated.

524
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,120
Do you know why?

525
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,480
Well...

526
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,240
I have two keys
to  help solve the mystery.

527
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,480
Keys?

528
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,080
One: A woman who bears
a grudge against Gomyo.

529
01:13:23,1000 --> 01:13:29,680
I know about it, because I
happen to live with her.

530
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,160
Are you boasting about her?

531
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,360
Anyway, the other is...

532
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,080
The fact that I was
the only other person there

533
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,440
When Heizaburo killed his father.

534
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,000
Heizaburo!

535
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,200
It's you!

536
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,520
Asakusa...

537
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,800
Hannyain Temple...

538
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,600
What his father said at that time

539
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,840
Is worth a hundred pieces of gold.

540
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,280
We'll talk about it some other time.

541
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,960
How about it?
Will you come to my house?

542
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,440
- No thanks.

543
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,440
It can be very dangerous.

544
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,440
Let's contact one anot her like this:
Kamesen, a teahouse by the river...

545
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,360
We'll attach letters
to  a willow tree there.

546
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,520
Teahouse by the river?

547
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,840
Yes. It's deserted.
Nobody goes near the place.

548
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,280
Called Kamesen?

549
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,880
Yes. Goodbye.

550
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,440
Satisfied now?

551
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,960
The tattooed one.

552
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,600
I’ve      been waiting for a man like you.

553
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:00,240
This is all.
It's everything I have.

554
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,240
You're worth a hundred gold coins.

555
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,760
Think so?

556
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,600
I know where he is.

557
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,680
Kill Gomyo when he slithers out.

558
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,160
Don't fail.

559
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,680
Rest assured.

560
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,440
Oriwa.

561
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,120
Thanks for your help.

562
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,240
I read the books you lent me.

563
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,520
And...?

564
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,840
What?

565
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,200
They included a travel diary.
This one.

566
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,160
Yes.

567
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,560
What about it?

568
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,840
Tanigawa-sama.

569
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,320
Tanigawa-sama...

570
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,720
Are you sure you don't remember
anything at all about your past?

571
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,000
Nothing.

572
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,000
But it's strange.

573
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,760
I can read.

574
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,120
This picture. Doesn't it help?

575
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,480
Doesn't it remind you of anything?

576
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,280
This sound.

577
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,240
This tinkle.

578
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,640
Doesn't it help?

579
01:19:26,1000 --> 01:19:28,400
Oriwa-san.

580
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:33,880
Ezo.

581
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,880
Kitamae Clan.

582
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,160
Don't these words help?

583
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,240
Who are you?

584
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,240
You know something, don't you?

585
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,440
Oriwa-san.

586
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,720
Heizaburo-sama!

587
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,240
Heizaburo-sama!

588
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,080
You do know something, don't you?

589
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:32,880
Oriwa-san.

590
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,640
Heizaburo-sama.

591
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,040
You're Sasao Heizaburo.

592
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,000
I don't know.

593
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,880
I don't know!

594
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,720
I'm sorry.

595
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,000
Tell me.

596
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,680
Who are you?

597
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,000
Tell me.

598
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:35,160
Hannyain Temple in Asakusa.

599
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,400
Hannyain Temple in Asakusa!

600
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:42,1000
Go there.

601
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,720
If you go there

602
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,360
You will know the whole story.

603
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,600
The man called Tanigawa Yataro...

604
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,320
I've got to get rid of him at any cost.

605
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:40,640
Why don't you call him Sasao Heizaburo.

606
01:22:41,1000 --> 01:22:45,400
He was a Kitamae samurai.

607
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,1000
Just before his clan was abolished

608
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,160
He and his wife were attacked.

609
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,080
They're both missing now.

610
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,480
They were attacked by your men.

611
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,280
You don't have to explain any more.

612
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,160
That's one of the rules
of the underground.

613
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,520
But, in any case...

614
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,480
Gomyo.

615
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,520
It's useless to
try to hide anything now.

616
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:28,640
It happened two years ago.

617
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,280
The Kitamae was abolished.

618
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,720
The only way to save the clan was

619
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,160
Through little Lord Kanemaru.

620
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,400
Kanemaru's guardian,
Sasao zenzaemon,

621
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,960
Tried to stop the
abolishment by using him.

622
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,480
He came to ask me to
appeal to Lord Tanuma.

623
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,1000
Our Lord went insane
and killed himself.

624
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,440
We may well be punished.

625
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:10,080
But abolishing our clan is too much.

626
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,760
We must prevent it at all cost.

627
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:19,720
Little Lord Kanemaru should
succeed as head of the clan.

628
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,120
Will you appeal
to  Lord Tanuma for us?

629
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:31,280
Fortunately, you're a good
friend of Lord Tanuma.

630
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:35,000
Please help us.

631
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,520
I dissuaded him.

632
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,560
He finally gave up and went home.

633
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,800
On his way,

634
01:24:46,1000 --> 01:24:49,600
The crest on his lantern caused him

635
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,680
to  be mistaken for me.

636
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,760
He was assassinated.

637
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,240
and the assassin
was Heizaburo, his own son.

638
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,200
He is now Tanigawa Yataro.

639
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,320
He killed his own father?

640
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,080
Strange fate!

641
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,760
with   zenzaemon dead

642
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:43,480
There was no way left
to  save the Kitamae Clan.

643
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:51,120
Whatever he said to Heizaburo
with   his dying breath...

644
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,720
We must know what it was...
and deal with it.

645
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,920
Or my dream may be ruined.

646
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,280
Gomyo, my dream about Ezo.

647
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,080
Why not join in?

648
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,960
Why not make up your mind?

649
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,880
What do you think, Gomyo?

650
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,520
Lotus blossoms sometimes
grow even in the mud.

651
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,480
But it has no meaning to me now.

652
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,000
Gomyo.

653
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,640
I can't answer right now.

654
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,200
What?

655
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:45,200
Our work involves gratitude.

656
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,160
It embodies both
gratitude and a sense of duty.

657
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:56,000
It consists of something
that money alone cannot satisfy.

658
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,840
Are you saying you need time?

659
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,240
Is that it?

660
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,760
Anot her thing...

661
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,920
What is it, Boss?

662
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,040
She tried to kill herself.

663
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,560
Why did she do that?

664
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,520
Don't worry about it.
Get a doctor.

665
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,720
Will you wait awhile?

666
01:27:33,1000 --> 01:27:35,400
I cannot wait too long.

667
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,560
I'll give you until midnight.

668
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,160
Very well.

669
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,1000
Midnight tonight.

670
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,600
Exactly.

671
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,960
The place: Here.

672
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:00,960
Gomyo.

673
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,720
Bring Sasao Heizaburo
here by midnight.

674
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,720
Understand ?

675
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,1000
If... You break your promise...

676
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,480
I suppose you know what'll happen.

677
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,1000
Don't worry about it.

678
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,160
No one in the organization

679
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:36,240
Ever has regrets if
anything happens to him.

680
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,400
Will you excuse me, then?

681
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,800
Remember your promise.

682
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,600
Remember.

683
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,440
Midnight.

684
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,200
Midnight, Gomyo.

685
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,440
He hasn't recovered
enough to go out by himself.

686
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,120
Any ideas about where he is?

687
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,360
He said "Family Temple".

688
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,640
Tanigawa-san was trying
to  visit it, right?

689
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:38,360
So that's it.
Hannyain Temple in Asakusa.

690
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,240
Boss...

691
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,880
That's it.
He must have gone there.

692
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,400
You still look like you did
when you were a child.

693
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,920
Your eyes, your mouth.

694
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,760
They remind me of how
you were 20 years ago.

695
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:20,680
You are the son of
Sasao zenzaemon, Heizaburo.

696
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:26,680
I'm certain you are
Sasao Heizaburo, a Kitamae samurai.

697
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,080
Sadahachi. Will you take
Oriwa to Kamesen?

698
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,760
Oriwa.

699
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,840
No.

700
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,720
I'd hate to part with you. No!

701
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,360
Listen oriwa.
There are things I must do.

702
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,680
I'll go as soon as I finish.

703
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,600
You go first and wait.

704
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,640
No. I don't want to.

705
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:33,1000
- Don't complain!

706
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,120
- No! No! No!

707
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,120
Oriwa!

708
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:42,440
No!

709
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,440
Boss... That's too much!
- Shut up!

710
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,280
Don't interfere!

711
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,760
Oriwa.

712
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,160
I'll take care of you.

713
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:06,680
Just be quiet and 
do as I say until then.

714
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,000
Got it?

715
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,480
Alright.

716
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,520
Now hurry!

717
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,600
Go.

718
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,040
What are you waiting for?!

719
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,640
Boss!

720
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,360
Boss!

721
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,280
Boss...

722
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,040
Listen, all of you.

723
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,280
Listen to what I'm about to tell you.

724
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,280
Boss...

725
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,1000
Why so formal?

726
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,520
As of now

727
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,320
I'm quitting the organization.

728
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,280
- What? What do you mean?

729
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,280
What's this all about?

730
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,720
I have no time to explain.

731
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:44,760
I'm tired of this kind of life.
I've had enough.

732
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,880
Listen. I'll tell you
one thing before I leave.

733
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,360
Tonight at midnight.

734
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,200
When the bell tolls midnight.

735
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,760
The police will attack this place.

736
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,200
Get your things together and run.

737
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,120
Get out and go where you like!

738
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,680
If you stay here,
You won't live to see tomorrow!

739
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,520
- That can't be!

740
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:15,080
The money you earned
and saved is in the back room.

741
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,760
Distribute it as your wish.

742
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,040
Boss! Wait a minute!

743
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,040
- Boss...

744
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,800
- Shut up!
I'm not your boss anymore.

745
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,400
No gratitude, no duty.

746
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,160
Forget about it
and think for yourselves!

747
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,040
Understand ?

748
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,320
Your father...

749
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,440
Before he left for Edo,
He entrusted me with

750
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,240
This letter case.

751
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:01,680
He said to give it to you in case
he didn't make it out alive.

752
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,800
It contains the charter

753
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,840
Signed by Tokugawa Iyeyasu,
founder of the Shogunate.

754
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,920
Giving Ezo to the Kitamae Clan.

755
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,520
The government cannot ignore it.

756
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,240
I firmly believe it.

757
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:31,400
Also, it can tell you where
The little lord is. Your father hid him.

758
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,960
So, your father entrusted
me to give this to you.

759
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,120
Priest.

760
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:43,440
What are you saying?
What is it all to me?

761
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:48,040
Your father died trying to
save his clan and his retainers.

762
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,920
Observe your father's will.

763
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,320
That's what you must do.

764
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,240
Why must I be the one to do it?

765
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:04,200
Man cannot aband on
his past as long as he lives.

766
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,720
Listen carefully, Heizaburo.

767
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,040
Running away will ruin you.

768
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:16,400
Stake your life on
reviving the Kitamae Clan.

769
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,280
I don't know.

770
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,160
Look, Heizaburo.

771
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,240
The fate of the
Kitamae Clan is at stake.

772
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,240
I don't know.

773
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,400
Heizaburo!

774
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:34,760
That sort of thing
has no meaning to me now.

775
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,640
Who are you?

776
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:17,440
We overheard the best news around.

777
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,280
Sasao Heizaburo!

778
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,240
We'll kill you
and take the letter case!

779
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:25,880
You're acting only
in your own interest.

780
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,240
Get out!

781
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:29,920
Heizaburo!

782
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,080
Take this letter case!

783
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,840
Heizaburo!

784
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,640
Heizaburo! Heizaburo!

785
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,040
The letter case! The letter case!

786
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,600
Heizaburo!

787
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,000
Hagino!

788
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,1000
Hagino!

789
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,840
Hagino!

790
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,760
Hagino!

791
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,680
Tanigawa-san!

792
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,360
Tanigawa-san.
get a hold of yourself.

793
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,560
Tanigawa. It's me.

794
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,720
You're all right now.
You can relax.

795
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,520
Tanigawa-san!

796
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:01,760
Boss...

797
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,080
What happened?

798
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:15,280
The past... I remember...

799
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:20,480
Really?
You can remember your past?

800
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,080
I can remember.

801
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:27,080
Is that so.
That's good. I'm glad.

802
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:34,560
No! No!

803
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,840
I want to stay as I am.

804
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,120
I'd rather stay as I am.

805
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,480
Tanigawa-san!

806
01:42:49,1000 --> 01:42:52,520
Tanigawa-san! Tanigawa-san!

807
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,240
Get a hold of yourself,
Tanigawa-san!

808
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,280
Boss!

809
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,680
Boss, we're here to help you.

810
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,040
Why are you here?

811
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,000
We're determined to die with you.

812
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,440
Fools!

813
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,440
Boss...

814
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:14,640
Take Tanigawa-san to
Kamesen's warehouse.

815
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,560
OK. Got it.

816
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,120
Tanigawa-san. Don't die! Stay alive!

817
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:52,920
Boss.

818
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,200
We got Tanigawa-san
safely aboard a boat.

819
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,120
Is that so?

820
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,360
Boss, let's hurry to Kamesen.

821
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,800
Oriwa is waiting there.

822
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:02,960
No.

823
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,080
But...

824
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,200
Never mind. It's all right.

825
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:10,480
Leave the two alone.
That's what's best.

826
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,560
Boss.

827
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,400
Where are you going?

828
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:20,760
I have something to do at midnight.

829
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,240
At midnight?

830
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:28,720
I'll meet Shimoguni at the
Somezen Dyeing Shop at twelve.

831
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,360
Somezen?

832
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:39,880
Everybody has
already gathered there.

833
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,640
Everybody? What for?

834
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,120
Until you've gotten safely away.

835
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:54,840
We're supposed
to  hold off the police.

836
01:44:54,1000 --> 01:44:55,960
Everybody's gathered?

837
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,480
Stupid! Don't do that!

838
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,080
Who are you?

839
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,320
I'm in the same business as you.
I'm Matsu, the tattooed one.

840
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,240
This is a good place for you to die.

841
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,920
I'm here to kill you.

842
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:29,200
Idiot!
Don't take us lightly.

843
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,280
Gomyo.

844
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,240
Die, you damn officers!

845
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,120
Damn you!

846
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,120
Get out of here!

847
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,400
Gomyo.

848
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,760
If you think you've won

849
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,560
You've got anot her thing coming.

850
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,200
The Ronin you're protecting...

851
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,800
What?

852
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:01,880
Oren is already after him.

853
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:07,160
She must have killed him by now.

854
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,520
They must be here!

855
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,840
Look everywhere for them!

856
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,400
Kamesen,

857
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:34,080
Isn't there any good news yet?

858
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,480
Omon! Omon!

859
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,120
We Iucked out.

860
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,320
He's coming on his own
like a moth to the fire.

861
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,240
Omon, you wait here.

862
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,400
We've arrived, Tanigawa-san.

863
01:52:49,1000 --> 01:52:51,520
Don't worry about the boss.

864
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,520
He'll surely come later.

865
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:17,960
Omon! Omon!

866
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,840
Omon!

867
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:24,960
Damn it!

868
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,120
Omon, you saw that boat, too?

869
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:34,880
The one with the Ronin aboard.

870
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,680
It disappeared right
in front of my eyes.

871
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,400
Omon, you must know.

872
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,1000
Is there a good place to hide a boat?

873
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,400
A secret inlet or something.

874
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,600
There must be a
cave leading to the river.

875
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,280
You know, don't you?

876
01:53:58,680 --> 01:53:59,760
Maybe...

877
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,120
That Ronin can earn me money.

878
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,800
Gomyo will be coming here.

879
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,040
Then Shimoguni-san
and the police will rush in.

880
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,520
Shimoguni will win in the end.

881
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,040
It's a good chance to make money.

882
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,560
Omon, will you tell me?

883
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,880
The basement of that
warehouse leads to the river.

884
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:45,760
That one?

885
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,320
That's perfect.

886
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:25,480
Omon, hurry and give me the key.

887
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,440
Forgive me.

888
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,120
Please forgive me.

889
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,840
After all i've done!

890
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:50,800
I don't want to die!

891
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:06,000
As soon as I find the boss,
I'll bring him here.

892
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,640
Sukegoro-san.

893
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:13,200
Good Iuck.

894
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,720
I've finally paid...

895
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,440
My debt.

896
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,480
Heizaburo-sama! Heizaburo-sama!

897
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,600
Darling.

898
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:23,920
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Oriwa-dono.

899
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:28,560
No. My name is...

900
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,680
Hagino. I'm your wife...

901
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:37,840
- Don't say any more!
You mustn't.

902
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:51,200
Please listen to me.

903
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:59,200
Go with the boss.

904
02:01:02,1000 --> 02:01:06,480
Stay alive with the boss.

905
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,480
Are you Shimoguni-sama?

906
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:43,920
I implore you.

907
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,1000
Please forgive the boss.

908
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:54,560
The boss?

909
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:02,760
Instead, i'll tell you where to find
the Ronin you're looking for.

910
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,840
Run!

911
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,560
Hurry! Run!

912
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,760
Hurry!

913
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:15,040
You're Sasao Heizaburo's wife,
Hagino, right?

914
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,440
The two of you,
Return to Ezo together.

915
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:13,960
Go.

916
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:58,240
Gomyo.

917
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:00,320
Is that...

918
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,640
The charter that decides
The fate of the Kitamae Clan?

919
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:08,240
Your dream...

920
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:12,000
and my way of
Life in the darkness...

921
02:13:13,480 --> 02:13:14,920
They're both staked on it.

922
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:18,720
Very well, Gomyo.

923
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:21,280
I'll obtain my dream...

924
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,760
.. with my own hands.

925
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:27,280
THE END
