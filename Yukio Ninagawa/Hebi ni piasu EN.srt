1
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,190
Know what a 'split tongue' is ?

2
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,190
What's that?
A tongue that's split at the end?

3
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,020
Right, like a snake or lizard.

4
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,000
Some people have them too.

5
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,130
Wow

6
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,120
Don't you ever want to modify your body?

7
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,050
is it ok?

8
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,090
hey..

9
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Didn't you say you'd pull out before...

10
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,280
sorry.. my timing was a little..

11
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,000
If you can't, use a rubber ok?

12
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,130
Hey!

13
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,210
Ama, long time no see.

14
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,070
This is Shiba, the owner.

15
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,140
Ah, my new girlfriend

16
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,030
Oh.

17
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,040
You caught a cute one

18
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,130
We came to get her tounge pierced.

19
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,050
Even girlies getting their 
tongues pierced now?

20
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,010
I'm not a girlie

21
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,230
She wants a split toungue too.

22
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,260
Put your tongue out.

23
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,220
Ah, pretty thin so it won't hurt much.

24
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,110
But since it's a muscle

25
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,240
It's going to be pretty tough, right?

26
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,070
putting a hole in that sort of tissue

27
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,260
is still ok?

28
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,200
Well... if you compare it to ears, 
it hurts more

29
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,240
But, if you put a hole anywhere

30
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,170
It will hurt

31
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,030
Hey, Shiba, don't scare her off.

32
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,130
It'll be fine, Lui. After all I've had it done.

33
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
What did you say?

34
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,030
When I pierced your tongue, you fainted!

35
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,020
Anyway, come this way.

36
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,210
Tattoos huh? I wonder if i should get one too?

37
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,170
Sit down.

38
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,280
Rinse out your mouth

39
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,160
- here you go
- thanks

40
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,220
A little further

41
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,030
Hold it

42
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,260
Where abouts?

43
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,010
Ok

44
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,280
Ready?

45
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
Have a look

46
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,070
Ok?

47
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,120
It went in straight and it's 
where you wanted it.

48
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,190
You really did it! Awesome!

49
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,190
Did you say your name is Lui?

50
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,240
Pain is a powerful thing, huh?

51
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,110
Women are better at enduring it

52
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,010
Tongues, genitals,

53
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,110
just piercing skin often makes guys faint.

54
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,280
Shiba, what do you think about split tongues?

55
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,000
Huh?

56
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,110
Split tongue?

57
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,150
It's completely different from tattoos and piercings

58
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,110
It's an interesting form of
expression, but not for me.

59
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,290
I think changing a persons form..

60
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,130
..is a privilege granted only to God.

61
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,170
Well, if you were God, what sort
of person would you make?

62
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,220
I wouldn't change their form

63
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,020
I'd make simple men

64
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,040
something like chickens

65
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,280
so they wouldn't come up with
an idea like God.

66
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,130
Could you show me some tattoo
designs next time?

67
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,080
Sure.

68
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,190
If you want to get in touch..

69
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,280
.. about piercing, or anything..

70
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,120
anytime..

71
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,220
Oh, how much for the piercing?

72
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,250
Don't worry.

73
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,290
When I saw your face,
the sadist in me got aroused.

74
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,150
I'm a masochist so
I guess it's my aura.

75
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,190
I'd love to stick a needle in this throat

76
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,120
That's kind of "savage"

77
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,060
It certainly is

78
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,270
You know the word "savage"?

79
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,170
I know those kind of words very well

80
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,230
Hey, Shiba!

81
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,000
Don't go around touching other guys girls.

82
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,160
I'm looking at her skin, for the tattoo.

83
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,240
When he smiled,
his face seemed to distort

84
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,080
No way! What is that?

85
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,060
That looks really painful

86
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,230
What were you thinking?

87
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not sure..

88
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,080
Pierced tongues aren't fashionable!

89
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,120
I met a punk a while ago

90
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,060
He kind of influenced me

91
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,270
What kind of person is he?

92
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
He looks like a punk, but inside,
he's kind of soothing

93
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,040
What?

94
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,290
What do you think about tattoos?

95
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,040
Tattoos? Tattoos are fine

96
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,260
Butterflies, roses, they're cute.

97
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,270
not those kind,

98
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,230
Dragons, ukiyoe, guys with
that kind of tattoo?

99
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,020
What are you saying?

100
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,110
You've met that kind of guy?

101
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,230
You're associating with that kind of guy?

102
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,020
Lui, I think maybe he brainwashed you!

103
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,110
Brainwashed?

104
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,030
Maybe, but..

105
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to know why..

106
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,180
seeing his split tongue makes me so excited.

107
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,220
It's a feeling like I'm running and can't stop.

108
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,240
Hey! Want to meet him?

109
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,120
Ah, he's here

110
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,280
Hey!

111
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,180
- Wait..
- Huh?

112
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,280
Are you serious?

113
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,140
Yep, the red hair guy!

114
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,010
He's scary!

115
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,020
-Hello
-Hello

116
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,060
Sorry if i look scary

117
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,270
No, no, just a little scary!

118
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is Ama

119
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,110
- Ah, I'm Ama.
- Maki

120
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,060
- Nice to meet you, I'm Ama
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,050
I'm Maki...

122
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,070
Maki, right

123
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,260
I've heard you have a soothing personality..

124
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,280
Ama, when you're walking with you

125
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,040
- everyone gets out of the way!
- really?

126
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,150
Really! Whenever you're with him!

127
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,200
Nobody stops you or tries to
give you anything!

128
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,210
Ah, so I'm useful!

129
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,270
It's handy!

130
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
A handyman!

131
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,040
Here we go!

132
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,150
So cool..

133
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,020
That piercing,
keep making the hole bigger..

134
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,230
.. then put a string in and pull
until it cuts it completely.

135
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,010
- Eeh? You're going to do this too?
- Sure.

136
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,000
Then we'll have matching tongues!

137
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,210
Lui, why don't you get your eyebrow and
lip pierced too? Then we'll really match!

138
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,210
No way! All i want is a split tongue and tattoo

139
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,090
Sorry for saying this but..

140
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,110
Don't lead Lui too far down the punk road

141
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,130
Me and Lui..

142
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,240
We're the same. We're fashion victims and
we're gonna be that way for ever.

143
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,050
We're not the same,
and i'm not a fashion victim!

144
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,270
You are!

145
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,010
Be quiet!

146
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,290
Fashion victim..

147
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,120
Aah, Miki.. that was strong booze

148
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,130
No it wasn't

149
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,140
Why was it my treat?

150
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,140
Thanks for lunch, it was delicious.

151
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,200
Anyway, it was fun.

152
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,060
It was our first meeting after all

153
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,270
Your face is red!

154
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,030
To our first night out!

155
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,010
- Which?
- left

156
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,190
- Cute huh.
- Yeah

157
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,290
She likes you, man.

158
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,190
Red-head!

159
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,120
This is our turf, you can't just
come walking in

160
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,230
What's with the piercings?

161
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,100
Where are you going ladies?

162
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,130
Who's the loser? boyfriend?

163
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,240
No way..

164
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,250
Where are you going..

165
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,210
Go wash your hair..

166
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,130
You'll catch something from him

167
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,230
Let's go somewhere

168
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,100
Whats with you?

169
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,110
What are you doing?

170
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,070
Stop it!

171
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,270
Stop it!

172
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,140
That was scary

173
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,160
Stop it!

174
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,140
Stop!

175
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,150
I'm sorry

176
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,270
Forgive me

177
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,250
I'm really sorry..

178
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,170
Ama! Ama!

179
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,290
Please stop it!

180
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,220
Enough!

181
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,170
Maki, run away! quickly!

182
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,070
We'll meet up again.

183
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,290
Please, enough!
We have to run!

184
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,220
The Police are coming!

185
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,290
Please

186
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,100
This way!

187
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,200
What were you thinking?
Idiot!

188
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,130
He offended you,
so I took these

189
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,220
I don't want anything!

190
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,090
Just for now, this is proof of my love

191
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,270
This is Japan, people don't do
that sort of thing

192
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm sorry

193
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,160
Huh?

194
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,190
Sometimes I can't control myself.

195
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,040
I know I should be more gentle.

196
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,290
I always thought I'd kill someone

197
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm scared I might one day.

198
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,220
Ama, you're an adult now..

199
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,080
If you kill someone you'll go to prison

200
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,290
Understand?

201
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,080
Well, I'm still a minor so.

202
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,090
Idiot.

203
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,240
It's true

204
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,010
When I met you, didn't you say you were 24

205
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,000
Ah.. well..

206
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,100
When we met I just thought of that

207
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,190
I didn't want to sound like a kid

208
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,190
Anyway, how old are you?

209
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,260
I'm still under-age.

210
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,250
No way, really?

211
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,200
That's made me so happy!

212
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,020
We're the same

213
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,120
..say Ama, What's your real name?

214
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,050
Amano?.. Suama?

215
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,110
What's Suama??

216
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,170
I'm Ama, like Amadeus

217
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,210
My surname is Deus

218
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,150
Like Zeus, only cooler!

219
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,290
Oh?

220
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,120
Well if you don't want to tell me it's ok, but

221
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,250
No it's true! What about you?

222
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,010
Me?

223
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,290
You probably thought I was bout 14?

224
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,010
Yep

225
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,140
I'm Lui as in Louis Vuitton

226
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,000
Aah, you're an expensive girl.

227
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,100
- Come here!
- Stop it!

228
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,110
Dragons are ok?

229
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,090
Yeah,

230
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,100
I should probably go for a dragon

231
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,130
Ah, this one is Ama's tattoo right?

232
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,280
Ah yes.

233
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,060
It was a little different but it was that design

234
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,010
Hey

235
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,270
Does Ama know you`re here?

236
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,010
He doesn't know

237
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,260
Don't tell him I gave you my mobile number

238
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,100
Um, about Ama...

239
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,150
You want to know about him?

240
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,270
hmm, probably not.

241
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,190
- I don`t need to know anything
- ok

242
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,280
What, what`s up?

243
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,140
I close the shop when important customers come

244
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,040
Oh

245
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,280
I`m still a little unsure though.

246
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,080
It`s for life

247
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,060
I want only the coolest tatoo

248
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,250
You don't get a second chance, huh.

249
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,060
In my case

250
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,160
If I grew my hair you wouldn`t see it, but.

251
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,040
I bet you have others too.

252
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,080
You want to see?

253
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,040
decorated playing cards?

254
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,040
Yeah, I love that sort of design.

255
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,210
What`s this?

256
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,220
A "Kirin"
(Chinese mythical creature)

257
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,040
This one

258
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,280
is my absolute favourite.

259
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,020
It's a sacred animal

260
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,100
They walk without disturbing the grass,
and don't eat other animals.

261
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,040
Kind of a god of the animal kingdom

262
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,060
That's beautiful

263
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,230
I had this done in Japan, but
by a top class tattooist.

264
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:44,030
He held a design of a kirin..

265
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,000
.. when he burned himself to death.

266
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,190
If I tattoo a kirin on you,

267
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,050
and it becomes angry, it will feel like a curse.

268
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,060
This is what I want.

269
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,290
Please Shiba

270
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,210
Please, design one for me.

271
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,180
Guess I have no choice

272
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,020
Thank you Shiba

273
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,220
I'll start working on the design

274
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,200
Do you have any requests about the setting?

275
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,230
This

276
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,060
I'd like it combined with Ama's dragon, but

277
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,080
About the same size as Ama's,

278
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,290
I'd like that on my back, but...

279
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,020
..how much would you want?

280
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,240
Hmm

281
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,130
1 sexual act

282
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,170
..ok..

283
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,270
Take off your clothes

284
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,090
You're so thin

285
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,020
If you get fat, the tattoo will stretch and look wierd.

286
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,020
It's ok. I've weighed the same for a few years now.

287
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,250
Oh.

288
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,090
You even cuter when you're in pain.

289
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm really turned on

290
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,220
Say, what kind of sex does Ama like?

291
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,130
Um..

292
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,270
Normal, i guess.

293
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,120
That's got to be frustrating.

294
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:26,200
Not really.. I can enjoy normal ok..

295
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,120
What?

296
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,100
I'm not normal, you think I can't come?

297
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,130
Can you?

298
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,000
No

299
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,070
So you're a mad sadist instead?

300
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,240
But I can with men.

301
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,010
I get turned on all kinds of ways

302
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,020
Are you wet?

303
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,100
Is it making you sick?

304
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,020
Painful? Huh?

305
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,260
- Do it
- Huh?

306
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,140
Hurry, do it, please!

307
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,010
Shut up

308
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,150
Keep crying

309
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,290
I'm ..

310
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,240
Will you contact me when the design is done?

311
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,190
Sure

312
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,180
Bring Ama too

313
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,280
I'll show you in secret

314
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:28,070
Ring me during the daytime ok?
Ama is at work then.

315
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,130
Sure thing.

316
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,170
I don't know if I'm a son of god..

317
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,290
Son of god?
You're more like a saw

318
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,290
God is definately a sadist,
for giving life to humans..

319
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Mary was a masochist?

320
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,160
Definately

321
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,080
Oh, have you had anything to eat?

322
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,020
Ama will be home by now so..

323
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,230
Ah

324
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,070
See you soon

325
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,060
Are you ok?

326
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,160
I don't want to be in this world

327
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,180
I want to burn brightly until the
very end of this dark world,

328
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,120
Many private think-tanks inside and outside
the country say grounds for concern are low

329
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,000
but the rate of the economic recovery
has once again slowed

330
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,010
highlighting the likelihood of decline
from the current situation..

331
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,050
Also in the news,

332
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,220
Around 1am on 11th in Shibuya, Tokyo

333
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,280
A man was found collapsed in a pool of blood.

334
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,050
Passers by who discovered him,
transported the man to hospital,

335
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,230
where died around 2 hours later
from head injuries.

336
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,180
The deceased, who is believed to
be a member of the Tooru Murata gang,

337
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,130
was 25 year old Satoru Yokoyama

338
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,290
The cause of death was cerebral contusion
caused by skull fractures

339
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,000
A suspect seen fleeing the area is
described as 20 years old,

340
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,260
between 175 and 180 centimeters tall,

341
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:13,240
with red hair, slender build and black clothing.

342
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,280
Police are asking anyone with information
about the whereabouts of the suspect

343
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,040
to contact Police Headquaters in Shibuya

344
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,200
Good evening

345
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,170
Ama! Ama! Wake up!

346
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,060
Lui, what's up?

347
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,080
- come over here
- what?

348
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,110
- quickly
- what's this about?

349
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,290
never mind!
ok, sit here please

350
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,050
we're changing your hair colour

351
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:08,230
that red doesn't suit you
it's bothered me for a while

352
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,130
It looks kind of dirty,

353
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,130
You should have more sense

354
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,030
Lui you're too kind

355
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,220
I should have more style i guess,
thanks for helping

356
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,090
Sure

357
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,090
Thanks, Lui

358
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,250
For you I'd even cut it all off

359
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,280
I'd wear whatever clothes you'd like

360
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,060
How about having my skin lightened?

361
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,030
Give me a break

362
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,220
Ama..

363
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,110
From tomorrow you have to
wear long sleeves.

364
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
Why?

365
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,170
Quiet..

366
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,260
If you wear sensible clothes you
won't look so dumb

367
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,170
Ok

368
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,060
- You understand?
- got it

369
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,170
Can you promise?

370
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,230
I promise. If it's for you, anything's fine

371
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,160
Stop pulling that face

372
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,190
Would you like another drink?

373
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,160
Thank you

374
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,100
Lui

375
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,270
Thank you

376
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,010
You suprised me
You really got your tongue pierced?

377
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,230
- A guy's influence?
- Ah, i guess.

378
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,250
I think it's his tongue I love..

379
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,060
Hello?

380
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,270
Hello Lui? Where are you? What are you doing?

381
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,250
Sorry, I got called in to help out with
some companion work.

382
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,020
What? You have a job?

383
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,010
What's "companion"?

384
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,270
Hey! It's a registration system

385
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,000
It's a normal kind of job..

386
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,200
Anyway, I'll call you back later.. bye!

387
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,100
Sorry

388
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,080
He try to keep you under control huh?

389
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:50,140
No, he's a just a bit immature.
He gets upset easily.

390
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
That's cute

391
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,060
It would be ok if it were just cute..

392
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,160
Ah, here you are. Skiving off work!

393
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,250
Sorry

394
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,260
Come on

395
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,120
Ama!

396
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,030
You're hair looks better this colour after all

397
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,190
- You think?
- Yep, very cool

398
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,160
Really?

399
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,240
Ah, you're as cute as ever

400
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,040
- You sure?
- Sure.

401
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,180
Hey look!
Split togue!

402
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,280
Hehe! Split togue!

403
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,260
Wait, wait..

404
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,270
I was relieved to see Ama laughing.
He seemed happy enough

405
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,260
His hair wasn't red anymore

406
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:22,280
I felt like there was no need to worry

407
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,210
Just going to buy cigarettes

408
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,190
Hello?

409
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,120
It's me. The design is done

410
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,220
A dragon and kirin as you requested.
It's not perfect but i've done all I can.

411
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,280
Ok

412
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,110
I want to show you as soon as possible

413
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,220
Ok

414
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,260
See you soon

415
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,150
Bye

416
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,070
Thank you

417
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,200
Who was that?

418
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,180
Ah, Maki. She said we should get
together again.

419
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,070
Yeah we should

420
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,250
Awesome!

421
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:20,800
Is it ok?

422
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,010
Will you tattoo it on me?

423
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,070
Sure

424
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,240
- You got it!
- Stop that

425
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,260
From tomorrow, don't drink alcohol

426
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:32,140
and make sure you sleep well

427
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,050
- I will
- Don't worry

428
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,170
I'm looking after her

429
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,230
Wow, when you walk down the street with
Shiba, everybody takes notice!

430
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,260
You stand out more than me

431
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,860
What are you saying?

432
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,260
You're both as scary looking as each other!

433
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,250
Phht

434
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,060
I bet we look like a pretty
wierd bunch all together

435
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,200
I want to go to a bar

436
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,190
- Good idea
- Let's go

437
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,160
I always thought I'd leave this area blank.

438
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,160
Here?... hmm, cool..

439
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,060
Sorry

440
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,210
I love this butterfly

441
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,280
Yeah?

442
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,210
This spot too

443
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,280
Toilet break

444
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,120
So, no complaints about the design?

445
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,020
Of course not

446
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,170
It will look so good on you

447
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,170
I have no doubt. It will be done
by your hand after all

448
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,220
Gods hand

449
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,280
When I tattoo you

450
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,080
If I get an urge to kill you
I don't know what I'll do

451
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,160
It's ok. What will be will be

452
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,120
I've never felt such a strong
intent to kill someone

453
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,000
There's puke all over the toilet

454
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,060
I feel sick now too

455
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,090
It was you wasn't it

456
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,170
It wasn't me!

457
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,190
I bet it was you

458
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,150
What are you saying? Honestly!

459
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,240
A toast

460
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,050
Aah, that's great

461
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,210
Shiba, this tastes great

462
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,000
Ama Deus, who killed for me,

463
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,140
the child of God who wants to
kill me,

464
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:13,000
I don't know which one is more
likely to kill me first.

465
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,080
Is it ok if I go tomorrow too?

466
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,260
Aren't you at work tomorrow?

467
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,210
Sometimes I don't trust Shiba

468
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,280
I'm worried, I don't want to lose you.

469
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:56,280
Don't worry about that. Shiba's a pro.

470
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,050
He wouldn't do anything like that

471
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:06,290
I know. But be careful, won't you..

472
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,140
Sometimes..

473
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,140
I don't understand him at all.

474
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
It's harder to find someone as easy
to understand as you

475
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,280
By this time tomorrow, there'll be
a dragon laying here

476
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,020
And a kirin

477
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,260
Your skin is so white, it's almost
a shame to spoil it

478
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,090
But it's gonna be so sexy.

479
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,110
Did you sleep ok?

480
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,180
Ama made sure I slept for 8 hours.

481
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,210
Ok

482
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,120
Today I'll do the outline

483
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:37,110
The design will be inked in completely

484
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,220
If there's anything you want to change, tell me now.

485
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,220
I do have one request

486
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,120
I don't want them to have any eyes

487
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,250
You mean the pupils?

488
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,290
Thats right, I don't want any black at the centre.

489
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,080
Why is that?

490
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,030
You know the story of the 'finishing touch'?

491
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,150
When you finish something,
you lose it at that moment 

492
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:25,080
Ok, I understand

493
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,280
I won't finish the eyes.

494
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,080
It may make the faces look unbalanced though,

495
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,110
Is it ok if I put some shading around the edges?

496
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,090
Thanks Shiba

497
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
Have it your way.

498
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,190
Is it ok there?

499
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,250
Ok

500
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,250
Hey, look

501
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,030
I'm up to size 10

502
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,280
Don't go too quickly

503
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,070
If you force it to expand too quickly

504
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,020
it will become inflamed and sore. It's different to ears..

505
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,100
Ok

506
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,030
- Is it hurting?
- uh-huh

507
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,010
I'll begin

508
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,240
Are you ready?

509
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,240
Tell me if it hurts too much

510
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,230
You can really stand pain, huh.

511
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,010
Most people can't, especially the first time.

512
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,040
I wonder if I'm just not sensitive?

513
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,050
No way, you're fine.

514
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,190
You are gentle after all

515
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,290
The first puff is the best

516
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:12,180
No way, the second is the sweetest

517
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:21,140
So, did you want to kill me?

518
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,070
Yeah, so I concentrated on the work

519
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:41,020
If you ever want to die,
would you let me do it?

520
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,230
Is it ok if I perform necrophilia too?

521
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:52,100
Why not, I'd already be dead..

522
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,190
But if I couldn't see you in pain

523
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,120
I probably wouldn't be able to get an erection

524
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,160
Lui, I'm here!

525
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,210
Ah, I've just finished

526
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,160
You finish work early?

527
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:15,060
Said I had constipation so I got to leave early

528
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:19,170
Where do you work that you get to leave early because of constipation?

529
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,100
Well, the boss got mad but whatever

530
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:33,020
Whoa! Shiba thank you!

531
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,190
But Shiba

532
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:39,020
did you do anything wierd with Lui?

533
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:42,260
Don't worry

534
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,200
I have no desire for skinny girls.

535
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,040
Wait.

536
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,110
Neither the dragon nor the kirin have any pupils..

537
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,080
I told him to do that

538
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,210
I said don't put them in

539
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,110
Why

540
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,280
If he puts the eyes in, they might fly away

541
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,020
Aaah, i see..

542
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,110
But, my dragon has eyes and it hasn't flown away

543
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,290
- Shut it.
- Ow, ow

544
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,190
Don't take a bath for a while, ok?

545
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:31,130
It will probably form a scab in a week or so

546
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,150
but don't scratch it.

547
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,150
After that, the swelling will subside

548
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,270
Then when the scab has come off completely, call me

549
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,020
Ok

550
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,190
Ah Shiba, want to go somewhere for a meal?

551
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,080
Half way through a job? Are you kidding?

552
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,220
Come here a second

553
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,060
Come here

554
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,130
Why did you come here in that dress?

555
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:03,020
You could have worn jeans to get the tattoo?

556
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,060
I thought I should wear something loose

557
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,090
So the air would get to the tattoo afterwards

558
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,130
Do you think I'm pathetic?

559
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,090
..just a little..

560
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,120
Do you hate me?

561
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,230
..just a little..

562
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,050
Sorry.. I'm sorry

563
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:51,070
I thought we might break up
but I really love you

564
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,210
Let's go

565
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:25,090
That day, I drank until i collapsed

566
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,240
Ama looked after me, as cheerfully as ever

567
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:34,090
One month after that day, Ama was still by my side

568
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:51,020
Each time I stretched the hole in my tongue

569
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,250
The pain made me wonder if it's worth while

570
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:56,280
and I take it all out on Ama.

571
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:00,270
Whenever I changed the piercing,
I started wishing everyone would die.

572
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,090
I was losing my values and sense of reason.

573
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:39,040
When the tattoo is finished and my tongue has been split

574
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,090
What will I think then?

575
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:45,030
I will have nothing left,

576
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,250
Care about nothing, and live without blame

577
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,290
In the future, the tattoo and split tongue

578
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,050
will surely have no meaning at all

579
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,230
I wonder if should I quit tattooing

580
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:23,000
Get a girl, live a normal life. Like Ama

581
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:28,050
Do you have to give up tattooing to do that?

582
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,070
I mean start a new life

583
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,200
I've tattooed the best kirin I can.

584
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:43,160
I have no feelings of regret

585
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,050
The dragon and kirin dancing on my back

586
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,200
will never be separated from me

587
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,150
We decided on each other

588
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,160
This relationship can't be betrayed

589
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:08,060
After all, they can't go anywhere if they don't have eyes

590
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:18,090
After the tattoo was completed

591
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,060
I really had no energy left

592
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,030
wanting everyday to pass quickly.

593
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,260
- Lui you shouldn't be drinking
- Shut up

594
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:32,020
Ama worried over my binging

595
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,220
And even though I wanted to respond to him..

596
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:39,000
every time, the loathing I felt for myself..

597
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,250
eventually pushed me back to drinking again

598
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,190
Anyhow, the absence of light

599
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:50,140
my life, my future and inside my head was total darkness

600
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,270
The only time i could sense any true feeling

601
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,210
was when I felt pain.

602
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,230
Lui, do you ever think you want to die?

603
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:11,220
Always

604
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,210
If you harmed that body of yours

605
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:25,200
I could never forgive you.

606
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,200
So if you do, would you kill me too?

607
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,120
Everybody else dominates you

608
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:49,010
But I have no influence at all. I can't stand it

609
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,290
If I did decide to die

610
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:01,160
Which should I ask to do it?

611
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:06,000
Which would do it most skillfully?

612
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,200
Yeah?

613
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:34,000
Ah, It's me
Is now a good time?

614
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,150
Is something wrong?

615
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:42,180
It's about Ama

616
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,150
What?

617
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:48,290
Was he involved in something around September time?

618
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,210
I don't know

619
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,230
Why?

620
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,060
The police came here a while ago

621
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,120
Said they wanted to see a list of tattoo customers

622
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,080
Customers with tattoos of dragons.

623
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,130
I don't think it's Ama, but..

624
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:13,150
It can't be Ama.

625
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,080
He's always with me.

626
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,070
That's right. Sorry

627
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:29,150
They said he had red hair too.
Didn't he have red hair?

628
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,270
I'm slightly worried

629
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,210
Yeah he did.

630
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:48,280
Anyway, I got a little worried and thought I should call you. Thats all

631
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,070
Are you coming today?

632
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:55,240
Ah, no thanks

633
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,170
Today's off, I'll come again soon though

634
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:06,200
You're not coming?
I have something to discuss with you

635
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,180
Ok, I'll come when I feel like it.

636
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,040
Hello

637
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,240
Why did you lie?

638
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,180
Tired?

639
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,160
I'm not joking, you seem odd

640
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,170
What?

641
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,030
When did we meet last?

642
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,230
2 Weeks ago wasn't it?

643
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,270
Are you losing weight?

644
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,230
I don't know. Ama doesn't have any scales

645
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,170
You're looking ill and worn out.

646
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:05,010
Your skin is looking bad and you smell of alcohol

647
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,250
Isn't Ama feeding you?

648
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,270
He never shuts up telling me to eat

649
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,270
But I'd rather just drink

650
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,150
So that's what you're doing? Starving yourself
before suicide?

651
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,270
I'm not committing suicide

652
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:49,230
Did you come to buy something?
What do you want?

653
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,020
I came for a beer

654
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,160
The beer's in the refrigerator

655
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,110
Is that all?

656
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:06,060
Shiba, have you ever killed anyone?

657
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,270
Yes

658
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,290
How did it feel?

659
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,130
It felt good.

660
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,020
Oh.

661
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,060
Take off your clothes

662
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:06,180
Didn't I come to buy something?

663
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:11,240
Your crying has turned me on.

664
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,260
Would you marry me?

665
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,230
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

666
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,120
Yeah

667
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:42,070
Ama is too much for you to bear

668
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:46,230
You are too much for Ama to bear

669
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,130
You two are not balanced at all

670
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,170
Therefore you think I should marry you?

671
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,060
Not particularly.. that's unrelated

672
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,200
It was just an after-thought

673
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:27,090
Anyway, I made you a ring.

674
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,030
You made it?

675
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,160
It's a hobby

676
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:41,130
Completely different from your hobbies, I know

677
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,270
It's cool

678
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,290
even if I shouldn't say so

679
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:57,140
Thank you

680
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,180
Just going shopping

681
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:35,240
The person you are calling is not in range
of our signal

682
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:39,050
or the phone is turned off, and cannot be reached.

683
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,250
The person you are calling...

684
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,190
- Excuse me
- Yes?

685
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,230
Can I report a missing person other than a relative here?

686
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,090
Yes you can

687
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,260
Well?

688
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,050
well?

689
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,020
The persons name?

690
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:03,160
I don't know Ama's full name

691
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:08,260
I can't report a person as missing
if I don't even know his name

692
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:22,170
What's Ama's name?

693
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:25,160
Huh? What's the hurry?

694
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:31,170
He hasn't come home.
I wan't to report him missing.

695
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:37,000
You don't know his name?

696
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:38,260
I don't

697
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,130
But you're living together.

698
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,080
So what?

699
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,290
Don't cry

700
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,250
Didn't you ever see a name
plate or letter or something?

701
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:57,060
Ama didn't have anything like a name plate.

702
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,230
The mailbox was always full of leaflets

703
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,240
'cos he never opened it

704
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:04,210
Did he go to work as usual yesterday?

705
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:08,160
But he didn't come home last night?

706
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:12,190
Right, he left for work as usual  but
didn't come home.

707
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:17,060
Why are you so upset after just one day?

708
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,110
It will be fine

709
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:24,190
He hasn't been home for 1 day, don't panic so much

710
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,240
He's not a kid

711
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:27,220
In all the time we've lived together

712
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,160
He hasn't spent 1 night away from home

713
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:32,040
He was once 30 minutes late leaving work

714
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:34,090
But he called me so I wouldn't worry.
That's how he is.

715
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:36,080
I know..

716
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:42,060
Ama, might have killed someone

717
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:48,180
The police said he was a Yakuza member

718
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:50,200
I told him not to

719
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,240
I told Ama to ignore him

720
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,230
Ama beat him up but..

721
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:59,020
I never thought he would die

722
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,130
Even when I saw it on the news

723
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:05,000
I didn't really think it was the same person

724
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:10,100
I was sure it was a different person
It couldn't have been about Ama.

725
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:19,090
If we report him missing to the police,
they may arrest him

726
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:26,000
If he knows about all of this and has gone on the run.

727
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,210
If he thinks we don't know about this,

728
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,280
he might have decided to disappear
without telling us.

729
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:34,110
I'm worried about him

730
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:40,290
It's too hard, not knowing where
he is or what he's doing

731
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:48,050
I don't think Ama would run away on his own

732
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:53,010
If he was going to, he would have taken me with him

733
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:57,000
I'm sure he would want me with him

734
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,090
Ok

735
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,220
Let's go

736
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,160
Why do you have a photo of him?

737
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,060
Ah,

738
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,130
When I did his tattoo, we took lots of photos..

739
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:34,060
Amada Kazunori, is it?

740
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,040
Yes

741
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:47,010
He's not called Ama Deus after all?

742
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,100
Are you ok?

743
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:21,140
Ama?

744
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:51,090
What's happened?

745
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:57,190
Why did you leave me behind?

746
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,290
Why did you go before me?

747
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:19,220
Didn't you say I meant everything to you?

748
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:26,060
Why have you left me alone?

749
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,190
Why?

750
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,160
Why?

751
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,280
What are you doing?

752
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,290
Hey, stick your tongue out!

753
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:08,220
Isn't that a zero? Weren't you at 4 yesterday?

754
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:11,190
Stop it

755
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,030
Take it out

756
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:27,040
You'll stretch it too far

757
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:41,100
When I get to 00 I can split my tongue

758
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:46,000
I know, I know..

759
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,270
Ama..

760
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:58,250
If Ama saw a 0 gauge pierce in my tongue,
what would he say?

761
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,220
He'd probably laugh..

762
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:10,060
and say "Awesome" !

763
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:15,030
"Just a little further"

764
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,220
I know..

765
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,050
that's what he would say

766
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:29,090
He'd be so happy

767
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:46,010
The person you are calling is not in range
of our signal

768
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:49,010
or the phone is turned off, and cannot be reached.

769
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,030
Hey

770
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,170
Do you know where Ama works?

771
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,150
What? You don't know?

772
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:07,080
I don't know.

773
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:12,240
We didn't know anything about each other

774
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:16,240
He works at a second hand clothes shop

775
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:20,160
You really didn't tell each other anything huh.

776
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,290
Did you discuss anything?

777
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,040
Hey, It's me.  It's about Ama

778
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:48,220
Ah..

779
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:54,040
He's not been in? What about yesterday?

780
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:58,170
If you find out anything, let me know ok?

781
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:08,230
He went to work as normal yesterday

782
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,000
but didn't today.

783
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:17,080
His boss is pretty angry.

784
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,100
I know the people there

785
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:29,070
They gave him a job without any questions

786
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:36,020
Does Ama have any family?

787
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:40,030
I don't know

788
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:43,190
I think he has one parent

789
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:49,180
He talked about his father once

790
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,170
Oh

791
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:18,270
What?
Nothing but beer

792
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:23,210
It's ringing

793
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,100
yes

794
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:30,150
yes

795
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:35,250
I see

796
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,190
Yes, I understand.

797
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:59,220
A body has been found in Yokosu.

798
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:06,260
They don't know if it's Ama,
but there is a dragon tattoo

799
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:15,110
They want us to go to the morgue
to identify the body

800
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:22,040
Alright

801
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,180
Ama is dead

802
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:21,040
He had been strangled to death

803
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:25,060
All over his body were cigarette burns

804
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:29,260
every finger and toe nail had been pulled out

805
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:33,280
something like an incense stick
had been inserted into his penis.

806
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,050
How should it be said?

807
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,080
he was killed after being beaten and tortured.

808
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:43,180
Like an object or a possession,

809
01:36:43,210 --> 01:36:47,200
he was played with and then killed

810
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:51,260
Lui, I'm going now

811
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:57,110
the last conversation we had

812
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:59,140
I had my back to Ama

813
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:02,080
I was thinking about meeting Shiba

814
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:04,170
See you later

815
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,010
When will you catch the killer?

816
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,250
We are doing all we can to investigate this matter

817
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,240
What? Am I being too pushy?

818
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,080
Please excuse me

819
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:54,070
Why did you come to the funeral when
you can't catch the killer?

820
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:58,120
and you're saying I'm pushy?

821
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:02,030
You don't have that authority

822
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,070
So, what?

823
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:07,090
So saying you can't catch his killer is ridiculous?

824
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:11,110
You're not trying because Ama killed too!

825
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:18,010
Why don't you all die!
Then everything will be settled

826
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,220
Calm down
You're not making sense

827
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:24,000
fuck off and die

828
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:58,270
We'll look after the store together
for a while

829
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:03,170
You have to take it easy
like the doctor said

830
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:31,250
When I left Ama's room

831
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,260
I went to live with Shiba

832
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:40,130
He tried to comfort me many
times, but couldn't

833
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:46,180
my lack of emotion meant he
couldn't even strangle me

834
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,120
Hey, Shiba

835
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:11,190
Ah, could you stop calling me Shiba?

836
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:16,140
My name is Shiba Kizuki

837
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:20,010
Sounds like a womans name, huh

838
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:26,180
I don't know why but everybody
calls me Shiba

839
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:30,030
What do you want me to call you?

840
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,230
Kizuki is fine

841
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,150
Kizuki

842
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,240
What?

843
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:42,080
You can't get any more in here

844
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,080
Ah yeah, it's full

845
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,020
Lui, is it ok if you
tell me your name?

846
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,100
You want to hear it?

847
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:03,150
Yeah, I'm listening

848
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,140
I'm Lui as in Louis Vuitton...

849
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:09,270
Your real name

850
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:13,150
Nakagawa Lui

851
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:17,170
What is Lui short for?

852
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:24,230
Lui, do you have any family?
Any parents?

853
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:29,240
I may look like an orphan but

854
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:31,260
I have parents

855
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:35,260
I think they live in Saitama

856
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,040
I'm surprised

857
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:43,000
You should go see them

858
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:54,010
I never had a conversation
like this with Ama

859
01:41:57,210 --> 01:42:02,130
I should have tried to talk
about normal things more often

860
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,010
about family,

861
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:12,110
about names, about age

862
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:21,050
Ama was 18 years old and I
only found out at his funeral

863
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:31,100
He was the first person younger
than me I ever hung around with

864
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:35,170
and I only found that out now he's gone

865
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:41,000
I wish I had realised that earlier
and talked with him about it

866
01:42:55,250 --> 01:43:03,190
The burns were all done with Marlboro
cigarettes, menthol flavoured

867
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,290
Of course, we're making progress with
saliva samples too

868
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:19,140
Also, the incense stick inserted
into the genitals

869
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:24,230
was a kind called 'Ecstacy', musk
variety imported from America

870
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:28,000
Surely incense is sold everywhere.

871
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:33,220
Yes, but.. in this area that kind
is not widely available

872
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:44,270
Also, we would like to ask you something..

873
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:54,170
Was Mr Amada bi-sexual?

874
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:59,290
Are you saying he was raped?

875
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:06,130
We found that out during the autopsy

876
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:12,210
No he wasn't bi-sexual. I can assure you

877
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:15,230
He definately wasn't that way

878
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,090
I see

879
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:05,050
No use

880
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,140
Oh.

881
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,170
You should rest

882
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:47,290
Where did you go? I was worried

883
01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:54,090
Ah, I went to buy incense.
I hate musk

884
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,030
I bought coconut

885
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:22,050
Whats up

886
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,230
Nothing

887
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:26,220
So Kizuki, you should grow your hair

888
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,280
I like long hair

889
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:34,170
Ok.. I wonder if I should
grow it once in a while

890
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:23,160
The symbol of Ama's love for me,
became part of me

891
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:57,190
Kizuki, I have one more request

892
01:51:58,030 --> 01:51:59,170
What is it?

893
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:06,030
Are you sure about this?

894
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:22,160
Ok

895
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:06,210
At last I can say this tattoo has a deep meaning to me,

896
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:09,200
for what my life has become.

897
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:12,240
I finally gave my dragon and kirin their eyes

898
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:15,080
I wonder if they will fly away?

899
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:18,030
I don't know

900
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,140
It's all ok.

901
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:43,090
If Shiba killed Ama

902
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:47,220
If Shiba raped Ama.. I accept it all.

903
01:56:24,130 --> 01:56:27,170
Is this all I wanted?

904
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:31,120
This unsightly, gaping hole is all I needed?

905
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,180
What are you doing?

906
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:46,130
I am making a river inside of me

907
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,110
Huh?

908
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:56,050
I just had a wierd dream

909
01:57:57,220 --> 01:57:59,090
What sort?

910
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:06,140
I was hanging out with a good
friend from a long time ago

911
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:11,150
but I was really late for an appointment

912
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:18,280
So my friend began to sing about his anger

913
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:27,220
5 or 6 people gathered around
and joined in the song...

914
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:37,070
If I had reached 00 gauge,

915
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:41,070
would the river have flowed more violently?
