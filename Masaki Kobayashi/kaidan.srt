1
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,765
Once upon a time,
in Hanyu of Shimousa,

2
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,463
there was an acupuncturist

3
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,735
whose name was Soetsu Minagawa.

4
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,801
He raised two daughters by himself
after losing his wife.

5
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,813
As a side business,

6
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,476
he lent his money
with a high rate of interest.

7
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:30,148
On a snowy night in late December,

8
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,420
Soetsu called
on a high ranking Samurai,

9
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,154
Shinzaemon Fukai,

10
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,664
to collect the loan.

11
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,064
He loaned 30 yen three years ago,

12
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:50,235
but it has ballooned
up to 65 yen with interest.

13
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,369
Please, Mr. Fukami.

14
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:57,041
I won't leave tonight
without my money back.

15
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,981
Too bad.
I have no money to pay you back.

16
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,685
If not the full amount,
how about half of your debt?

17
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,661
I want to buy nice New Year's Day
dresses for my daughters.

18
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,994
I've already told you.
I have no money.

19
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,204
But you have money
to buy some sake, I suppose.

20
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,740
Watch your mouth!

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,743
Who do you think you are?

22
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:32,481
You owe me.
You can't get away with it.

23
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,545
You tell me when you
could pay me back.

24
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,855
Back off. Otherwise,
I will report you to the authority.

25
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,226
Are you threatening me?

26
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,097
You are the one to be reported.

27
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,663
You're insulting me!

28
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,677
Shinzaemon won't stop.

29
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:05,273
Soetsu searches for something
to defend himself...

30
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,717
and he finds a sickle buried in snow.

31
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,052
Fighting back against a Samurai?

32
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,796
Poor Soetsu.

33
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,064
He doesn't deserve such injustice.

34
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,698
Soetsu begs for his life,

35
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,538
but the Samurai is ready for...

36
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,849
Mr. Fukami...

37
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,820
I'm going to come back and kill you.

38
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,656
Shinkichi!

39
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,191
Shinkichi!

40
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,701
What's wrong?

41
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,105
There is a deep pool nearby.

42
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,371
It's called Kasanega-fuchi.

43
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,140
A woman whose name is Kasane

44
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,671
was killed there by her husband.

45
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,881
They say that her spirits still live there.

46
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,948
And it swallows anyone
who steps into the pool.

47
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:25,225
To avoid any criminal charge,

48
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:30,326
Shinzaemon orders his men
to dump the body there.

49
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,965
May his soul rest in peace.

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,201
They sent the sickle
down with the body,

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,439
hoping it might calm his soul.

52
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,244
Soetsu's two daughters,
Oshiga and Osono,

53
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:51,382
searched and searched
for their father in vain.

54
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,894
Since then,
the Fakami family suffered

55
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,327
from various mysterious tragedies.

56
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,366
Shinzaemon became insane.

57
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:07,601
He killed his wife
and then killed himself.

58
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,172
Shinkichi,

59
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,543
you're the only one left.

60
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:23,088
This is the beginning
of Kaidan.

61
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,594
"KAIDAN"

62
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,875
"25 YEARS LATER"

63
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,843
"EDO, OLD TOKYO"

64
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,139
Uncle, I'm ready.

65
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,075
Have a good day.

66
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:40,749
Tobacco!

67
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:45,093
Would you like tobacco?

68
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:50,124
High quality! Very popular!

69
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,693
Hey, Shinkichi!

70
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,703
Hey.

71
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,003
Would you like tobacco!

72
00:07:56,075 --> 00:08:01,206
If

73
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,083
Your

74
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:14,684
Heart

75
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,627
Has

76
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:22,157
Changed

77
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,725
One more time.

78
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,410
If

79
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,139
Your

80
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,202
- Heart
- No, no.

81
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,980
Your heart has...

82
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,110
Now you try.

83
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:46,147
Your heart has

84
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,626
Your heart has

85
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,722
Your heart has

86
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,164
Good. Do it again.

87
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,765
If

88
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,441
It's a chilly day, isn't it?

89
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,710
Yes, it is.

90
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,491
Would you like some tobacco?

91
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,197
High quality!

92
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,173
Popular brand!

93
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,452
Would you like some tobacco?

94
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,032
No, thank you.

95
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,872
Well, maybe I should get some.

96
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,352
She is Toyoshiga,

97
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,626
whose father, Soetsu,
was killed by Shinzaemon.

98
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,224
And Shinkichi is Shinzaemon's son.

99
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:42,002
They have no idea about
their eerie connection.

100
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:47,842
This is the beginning of
their destined relationship.

101
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,016
Shinkichi's tobacco
really tastes good.

102
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,683
I couldn't buy one
from any other shop.

103
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,625
My lady loves its smell.

104
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,220
You mean that old lady?

105
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,095
Thank you.

106
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,500
Can I have some?

107
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,333
I'm gonna buy the entire box.

108
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,101
Oh, come on.

109
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,437
Stop that, please.

110
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,876
I'm going out to the public bath.

111
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,284
In the rain?

112
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,653
I'm sure it makes
the bath less crowded.

113
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,063
Enjoy.

114
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,375
Hello.

115
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,640
I hope it will clear up soon.

116
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,649
Why don't you come in?

117
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,845
Mistress, you're going somewhere, right?

118
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,787
Your tobacco is going to get wet.

119
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,758
I don't want to give you any bother.

120
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,463
You're already bothering us
by standing right here.

121
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,129
Come on.

122
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,974
I didn't know you were so stubborn.

123
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,982
It has turned into snow.

124
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,728
Well, I should be going now.

125
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,487
Mistress, Happy New Year!

126
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,893
Happy New Year to you.

127
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,238
Happy New Year.

128
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,837
Keep working hard.

129
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,938
Yes, mistress.

130
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,784
How long have you been working?

131
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,252
Three years.

132
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,312
Wow, really?

133
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,726
I promise this will be my year.

134
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,322
I even pray to God for it.

135
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,731
I don't think so.

136
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,292
We haven't seen Shinkichi for a while.

137
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,099
That's true.

138
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,936
I must wonder why.

139
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,306
I hope he is not sick or anything.

140
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,660
Mistress.

141
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,338
It never clears up, huh?

142
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,670
It hurts my business.

143
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:15,772
I haven't seen you for a while.

144
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,715
Everybody worries about you.

145
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,649
How have you been?

146
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,247
The same as usual.

147
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,358
Well, you're fine, right?

148
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,195
It's strange.

149
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,703
I see you whenever it snows.

150
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,804
It won't stop, don't you think?

151
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,107
It will stop snowing by night.

152
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,913
And the snow will melt away
by tomorrow morning.

153
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:00,188
Come with me.
My place is right over there.

154
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,784
I appreciate your offer, but...

155
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,413
It is gonna be heavy snow.

156
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,958
Yes indeed.

157
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,864
Why don't you come over by the fire?

158
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,761
I will never see you again.

159
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,862
Thanks to your help,

160
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,963
my business is really going well.

161
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,635
But...

162
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,804
I can't see you again.

163
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,407
Why?

164
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,112
Someone will gossip
if I keep coming here.

165
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,677
About what?

166
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,285
I come here because I want to see you.

167
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:50,958
I fell in love with you at first sight.

168
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:56,997
I have kept telling myself
to forget about you.

169
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,270
But I can't...

170
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,106
What's wrong with you?

171
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,344
I'm too old for you.

172
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,717
I like older, mature men

173
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,053
of a strong build.

174
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:19,155
I can't stand
a young, immature man.

175
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,663
I knew it.

176
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,171
I'm prepared for your rejection.

177
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,807
You have someone in your mind.

178
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,126
No, I don't have anyone.

179
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,204
You're skinny.

180
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,142
Not my type.

181
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,142
Stay with me tonight.

182
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,248
I'm lonely.

183
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,062
It's a beautiful day.

184
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,269
Well, that means you can go home now.

185
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:31,082
I know men never stay with women.

186
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,759
Mistress.

187
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:48,002
My father disappeared
on a snowy night.

188
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,939
The following morning was beautiful,

189
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,238
Just like this.

190
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,413
My little sister and I
searched for him everywhere.

191
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,913
By noon, the snow melted away.

192
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,953
We got muddy.

193
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,465
Hello.

194
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,698
Hello.

195
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,781
Hello, sister!

196
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,653
Are you home?

197
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,861
I'm coming in, okay?

198
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,525
I've made you a kimono.

199
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,545
Hi, sister.

200
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,250
I didn't know you were here.

201
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,190
Hi.

202
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,818
Let's go over there.

203
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,987
I don't understand why she chose

204
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,260
such a young guy like Shinkichi.

205
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,768
He has changed.

206
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,603
He behaves like a big shot now.

207
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,308
Honestly, I envy him.

208
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,903
I wish I could be with her.

209
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,175
She has disappointed me.

210
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,810
Where has her dignity gone?

211
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,923
You want one?

212
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,274
Stop it.

213
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,917
What the hell are you doing?

214
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,290
Well...

215
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,425
Let's start over. From the beginning.

216
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:56,315
Never talk back to me again!

217
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,015
I didn't.

218
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,580
Say only yes to me. Understood?

219
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:05,426
How dare you embarrass me!

220
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,397
I'm sorry.

221
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,160
You treated me like shit.

222
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,211
Then why don't you quit?

223
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,549
I don't need you to be my student.

224
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,717
I want to work with you.

225
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:38,320
But my mom doesn't
like me to come here.

226
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,024
She thought this was a decent place,

227
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,498
but recently...

228
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,728
My personal life
is none of your business.

229
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:49,001
Tell that to your mother.

230
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,372
Work with other mistresses.

231
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,309
But I want to be...

232
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,875
Go wherever your mom prefers.

233
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,552
You're annoying.

234
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,434
Ohisa?

235
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,335
I don't want to see you again.

236
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,217
Ma'am.

237
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,220
You can also quit if you want to.

238
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,451
She just got here.

239
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,789
Not right now.

240
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,852
I don't feel well today.

241
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:56,970
Her training has given me a chance
to enjoy something.

242
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,237
My life is miserable.

243
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,040
My mom is very hard on me.

244
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,308
Still having trouble with her?

245
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,653
Come again.

246
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:28,202
I had a dream
about our father again.

247
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,666
As usual, he complained about you.

248
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:36,475
"How dare she end up
with Shinkichi?"

249
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,016
"God will punish Shiga for it."

250
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,645
He is the one
who has abandoned us.

251
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,188
Sister.

252
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,257
I have to agree with him.

253
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,987
Break up with Shinkichi.

254
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:56,860
You know this relationship
won't last long, don't you?

255
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,460
Let's go back to our hometown.

256
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,937
You could forget about him.

257
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,099
We'll be fine.

258
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,939
I will never leave him.

259
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,947
I want to be with him
no matter what's gonna happen.

260
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,253
Get out of here!

261
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,988
You go back to our hometown alone!

262
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:28,522
I don't want to see you again!

263
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,966
Sister, please!

264
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,731
Listen to me!

265
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,773
What's wrong with you two?

266
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,330
Behave yourself.

267
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,021
Are you all right?

268
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,927
Yes.

269
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,302
Thank you.

270
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,176
I'll never come back here.

271
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,840
Take care of my sister.

272
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,384
Osono.

273
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,419
Good-bye.

274
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,071
Be nice to your sister.

275
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,907
She is the only family you've got.

276
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,573
You are also too hard
on your students for no reason.

277
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,542
Why don't you treat them nicely?

278
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,349
They admire you.

279
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,619
Why are you so nice to Ohisa?

280
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,320
She has a hard time
with her stepmom.

281
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,362
But she never grumbles.

282
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,389
Right. She is better than me, huh?

283
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,196
What's wrong with you?

284
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,438
Students left you because of me.

285
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,317
Thank you for having
been so nice to me.

286
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,081
I should go back to my uncle's.

287
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:34,250
I don't care about the students.

288
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,761
I can't live without you!

289
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,922
Don't you get it?

290
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,863
I don't want to ruin your life.

291
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,094
No! I won't let you go anywhere!

292
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:48,468
Please, no! I love you.

293
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,234
Please.

294
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm doing this for you.

295
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,807
No!

296
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,521
Ma'am!

297
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,926
Are you okay?

298
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,731
Oh, my God.

299
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,412
Does it still hurt?

300
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,881
How about you, dear?

301
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,583
I'm all right. Don't worry.

302
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:47,055
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...

303
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,294
No, this is my fault.

304
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,360
I've hurt your pretty face.

305
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,476
What's wrong with me?

306
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,310
I'm blaming everyone.

307
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:08,717
Even though I regret
what I say every time.

308
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,555
I guess I'm crazy about you.

309
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,059
What should I do?

310
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:21,064
This is too painful.

311
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,836
I wish I had never seen you.

312
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,006
I won't go anywhere, okay?

313
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,747
I don't deserve your love.

314
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,951
I'm nobody.

315
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,689
But you still love me, huh?

316
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:05,031
I'm very lucky... to have
someone who loves me so much.

317
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,736
My dear...

318
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,980
you really mean it?

319
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,487
Yes, I mean it.

320
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,551
I will never forget your words.

321
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,859
I won't.

322
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,808
Ma'am?

323
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,218
Ma'am!

324
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,964
It's a vicious swelling.

325
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:10,269
If it gets worse, I have to
cut it open to get rid of pus.

326
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,644
My dear...

327
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:25,121
Please come here, my dear.

328
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,960
I had a bad dream.

329
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:39,799
My ears decomposed and fell off.

330
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,101
Don't worry. It's just a dream.

331
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,974
Shinkichi.

332
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,742
Please nibble my ears.

333
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,017
I need you to do it.

334
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,150
Something's driving me nuts.

335
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,029
Harder!

336
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,509
You need to have a rest.

337
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,577
Once the swelling is healed, you'll be fine.

338
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,083
I know I won't get better.

339
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,320
Don't say that.

340
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:41,058
My care means nothing to you?

341
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,862
I can see...

342
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:49,168
I can see what's
gonna happen to you and me.

343
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,767
I see everything.

344
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,971
I need some air.

345
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,721
Remember?

346
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,486
You've been looking forward
to seeing the fireworks...

347
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,322
Of course!

348
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:16,066
I want to go to see them.

349
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,561
Go home by yourself now.

350
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,369
Don't tell this to our mother.

351
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,536
Shinkichi!

352
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,952
Are you here to see the fireworks?

353
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,146
No.

354
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,984
To get some medicine for my mistress.

355
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,925
How is she doing?

356
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,324
Not so good.

357
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,522
She can't leave the bed.

358
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,929
Can I go see her now?

359
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,057
Not a good idea.

360
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,329
She gets emotional if she sees women.

361
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,730
I see.

362
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,004
Then I guess I'll see you soon.

363
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,089
Here you go. This is your room.

364
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,775
Enjoy.

365
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:05,697
I've made up various
excuses just to see you.

366
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,762
To see me?

367
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,740
I'm planning to leave my family.

368
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:12,798
Really?

369
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,240
I sent a letter to my uncle in Hanyu,

370
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:27,689
asking to let me live with him.

371
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,888
He sent me a letter right away
to tell me that I would be welcome.

372
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,365
Hanyu, huh?

373
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,666
It's far away.

374
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,668
Which means I can't see you again.

375
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,840
I'm sure I will see you again.

376
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,651
I'm from Hanyu.

377
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,819
I don't remember anything
since I left it when I was young.

378
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:17,335
Do you know why she
is so hard on me?

379
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,400
You're so pretty.

380
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,843
She is jealous of that.

381
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:29,245
She is aware of...

382
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,084
my...

383
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,124
real feelings.

384
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,024
I wish I could take you to Hanyu.

385
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:26,740
If you are gone, who would
take care of our mistress?

386
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,677
You care about her, don't you?

387
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,773
That's why you're taking care of her.

388
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,778
She needs me.

389
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,219
Nobody counts on me like her.

390
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,120
I can also say that nobody
torments me like her.

391
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,229
I need your strength.

392
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,395
I wish I had your determination.

393
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,268
No.

394
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,832
I'm weak.

395
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:08,080
When my stepmom beats me,
I just try to suck it up.

396
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,450
Otherwise I can't stand my life.

397
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:20,797
I can't live there anymore.

398
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,763
I'll go to Hanyu with you.

399
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:03,034
My mistress and I don't
have a future together.

400
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,283
My dear, where are you?

401
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,441
What the hell
are you doing, Shinkichi?

402
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:55,747
Our mistress is sick in bed,
and you're wandering around?

403
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,878
Are you listening to me?

404
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,698
What are you going to do with these?

405
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,471
Sell them. I need some money.

406
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:21,875
What?

407
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,742
I'm leaving Edo.

408
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,509
What about our mistress?

409
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:29,484
That's why I'm selling them.

410
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,453
You son of a bitch!

411
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,558
You are like her husband.

412
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,356
You were nobody, remember?

413
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,623
She is the one to have supported you.

414
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:08,356
She has been waiting for you.

415
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,222
Why are you here?

416
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,591
I suspect that you
don't like me anymore

417
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,466
and have left me.

418
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,767
Please forgive him.

419
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,365
He is still young and immature.

420
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,239
He just needs your guidance.

421
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:30,940
Shinkichi, you can go anywhere.

422
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,574
I don't care.

423
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,148
But...

424
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,354
come back to see me off when I die.

425
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:52,197
Oh, come on. You just need a rest.

426
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,049
She is not doing well.

427
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,821
Take her home very carefully.

428
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,021
Yes, sir.

429
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,169
Who is it?

430
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,803
Wait here for a second, okay?

431
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,212
I'm coming.

432
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,249
Who is it?

433
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,312
Is Shinkichi here?

434
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,757
Oh, you are here.

435
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,352
I've been looking for you everywhere.

436
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,022
What's the matter?

437
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,831
She just passed away.

438
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,268
Are you kidding?

439
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,038
We're seeing her off right now.

440
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,010
Get out of here.

441
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,118
Shinkichi.

442
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,885
Where have you been?

443
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,391
Our mistress...

444
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,962
Shinkichi!

445
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,046
We found this by her bed.

446
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:16,828
If you marry someone,
I'll come back to kill her.

447
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,137
Remember that.

448
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:31,206
If you marry someone,
I'll come back to kill her.

449
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,112
Remember that.

450
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,081
I thought you had
already left for Hanyu.

451
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:51,219
I feel very sorry for her.

452
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,922
I shouldn't have
asked you out that night.

453
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,261
I'm the one to be blamed.

454
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,184
Ohisa!

455
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:21,680
Do you still want to go to Hanyu?

456
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,124
You want to go with me?

457
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,559
You and me together.

458
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,434
I cried a lot.

459
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:43,502
I thought it was over between us.

460
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,172
It's not over.

461
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:53,022
Take me to Hanyu.

462
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,751
Please.

463
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,918
Take me with you.

464
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:18,496
Come here.

465
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,747
Are you okay?

466
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,156
Yes.

467
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:48,370
We should have stayed in a lodge.

468
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,030
We will be there soon.

469
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,836
It's on the other side of the pool.

470
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:58,444
Looks like it won't stop raining
until tomorrow morning.

471
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,006
You want to go back to the town?

472
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:08,547
We are not in a hurry anyway.

473
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,490
I want to eat a warm meal
in front of a fireplace.

474
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,595
We're being followed.

475
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,431
By whom?

476
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,205
I can't hear anything.

477
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,293
See?

478
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,599
It's coming.

479
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,919
Ohisa! Wait!

480
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,334
Don't look.
