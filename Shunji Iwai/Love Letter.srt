1
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,741
It is already 2 years

2
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,253
since our son,
Itsuki, passed away.

3
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,757
To see you all who had extended

4
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,829
warmth and kindness to him
at this memorial service

5
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,362
should surely make Itsuki happy.

6
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,046
Everybody. Please help yourself.

7
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,449
Sweet wine.

8
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,318
Wow, this is great.

9
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,153
Frankly, I prefer something dry.

10
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,955
Hey, Yasuyo.

11
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,823
Didn't we bring
any <i>sake</i> with us?

12
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,332
You can drink your fill later.

13
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,332
Come on. It's his memorial.

14
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,874
Hiroko.

15
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,308
Akiba and the gang said

16
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,387
sorry they couldn't attend.

17
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,052
I see.

18
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,817
They're repenting at home.

19
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,518
Repenting at home?

20
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,419
They still feel guilty about it.

21
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,326
Akiba quit mountain climbing
since that incident.

22
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,229
For them

23
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,829
Itsuki's death is not
an event of the far past.

24
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,975
Would all of you gather?

25
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,634
The famed photographer is here.

26
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,010
Well... tonight...

27
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,517
Akiba and the gang plan
to secretly visit the grave.

28
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,496
Hiroko, would you mind

29
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,434
dropping her
in front of our house?

30
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,899
She seems to have a headache.

31
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,068
Don't push me around like this.

32
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,847
You're Hiroko, aren't you?

33
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,143
Already drunk?

34
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,240
He's hopeless.

35
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,784
He drank the whole bottle
of <i>sake</i> by himself.

36
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,783
Hiroko.

37
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,414
Please forgive him, Hiroko.

38
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,099
Must be straining for him.

39
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,904
He's just acting busy.

40
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,814
The drinking party
will go on all night long.

41
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,793
Looking forward to the party,
but thinks he shouldn't show it.

42
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,127
After all, the death anniversary

43
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,432
is an excuse to drink one's fill.

44
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,829
Mrs. Fujii, how's your headache?

45
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,302
Oh, that? I was just faking it.

46
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,408
What?

47
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,943
You're all so full of schemes.

48
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,977
Well, I'm not hurting anybody.

49
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,720
Akiba and the gang
are scheming something, too.

50
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,564
You don't come see us anymore.

51
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,771
Visiting us won't hurt.

52
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,476
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,378
I started
displaying them, but...

54
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,613
I had to prepare for today.

55
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,224
I only got half way through.

56
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,235
We keep the room closed recently.

57
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,041
Sorry for the dust.

58
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,516
Hiroko.

59
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,420
Would you like to see this?

60
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,993
The junior high yearbook.

61
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,932
You lived in Otaru?

62
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,696
Yes.

63
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,439
Where about in Otaru?

64
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,443
The house...

65
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,746
It's no longer there.

66
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,214
They built a highway over it.

67
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,376
That's too bad.

68
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,280
Look here.

69
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,220
It's him.

70
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,792
He transferred
before graduation.

71
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,888
He had the resemblance.

72
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,300
Seeing this picture now

73
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,904
his existence seems obscure.

74
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,773
Would you like some cake?

75
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,640
Ah... no, thanks.

76
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,643
It's from Comme Chinois.

77
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,974
In that case...

78
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,739
Fujii Itsuki...

79
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,641
Fujii Itsuki...

80
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,406
Fujii Itsuki...

81
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,518
Found it.

82
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,655
2- 24, ZENIBAKO. OTARU CITY

83
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,827
What's the big secret?

84
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,862
Akiba and the gang...

85
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,138
They're planning
an ambush tonight.

86
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:13,979
An ambush?

87
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,045
They'll secretly visit the grave.

88
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,612
Then Itsuki'll be busy tonight.

89
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,092
What's the matter, Itsuki?

90
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,799
Aren't you going to work?

91
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,210
I have a cold.

92
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,678
The cold this year is persistent.

93
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,476
Like someone I know.

94
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,315
By the way,
I have tickets for a movie.

95
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,519
Let's go see it.
How about Saturday?

96
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,282
No.

97
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,150
How about Sunday?

98
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,050
It's freezing.

99
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,921
You can't
always be busy, Itsuki?

100
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,791
I am.

101
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,157
Itsuki... Itsuki.

102
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,634
The letter.

103
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,141
Itsuki.

104
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,008
Itsuki, the letter.

105
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,351
Itsuki.

106
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,186
What?

107
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,788
This... you dropped this.

108
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,219
A love letter?

109
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,695
Itsuki.

110
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,931
Itsuki, how about next week?

111
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,918
Wa-ta -na -be Hi-ro-ko?

112
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,125
Who could it be?

113
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,944
"Dear Fujii Itsuki,
How are you?"

114
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,743
"I'm very well.
- -Watanabe Hiroko"

115
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,056
What the hell is this?

116
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,161
Who is it from?

117
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,938
<i>Letter of Misery?</i>

118
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,141
It doesn't seem to be that.

119
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,540
Grandpa, dinner's ready.

120
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,215
Ms. Watanabe in Kobe...

121
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,682
Isn't she your acquaintance?

122
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,308
<i>Ms. Watanabe?</i>

123
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,280
Look at it.

124
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,544
Must be someone you know.

125
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,351
No, I don't know her. I'm definite.

126
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,890
Watanabe Hiroko...
This is really weird.

127
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,256
Isn't it weird, grandpa?

128
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,696
Let me.

129
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,069
I don't know anyone in Kobe.

130
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,532
How would I know.

131
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,443
Didn't you see a doctor?

132
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,675
It's not that serious.

133
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,879
Those pills're
only for slight colds.

134
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,218
Then you'll go to work tomorrow?

135
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,179
If not, go to the hospital.

136
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,382
Itsuki, let me see the letter.

137
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,823
Rather work like a slave

138
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,884
than go to the hospital.

139
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,362
The girl
who got married recently.

140
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,992
Different last name now.

141
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,467
I knew it.

142
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:09,197
She got married
and became... Mrs. Endo.

143
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,771
Gleeeenek.

144
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,005
What?

145
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,842
Kleenex.

146
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:26,954
Watanabe Hiroko...

147
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:36,995
My God... this is aggravating.

148
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:44,499
DEAR WATANABE HIROKO

149
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,873
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko,"

150
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,580
"I'm basically fine
but I now have a cold."

151
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,204
"Dear Fujii Itsuki,"

152
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,466
"How is your cold?"

153
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,168
"Try these pills
and get well soon."

154
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,745
"- -Watanabe Hiroko"

155
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,298
It's pretty bad.

156
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,306
<i>My love runs on the south wind.</i>

157
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,276
Goodbye, Mr. Akiba.

158
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,039
Take care.

159
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,241
Goodbye, Ms. Watanabe.

160
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,117
How was it?

161
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,120
The memorial service.

162
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,826
Well, it turned out
pretty well...

163
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:11,994
<i>Pretty well?</i>

164
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,599
Pretty well is

165
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,356
pretty well.

166
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,894
Something good happened?

167
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,407
I can see it in your face.

168
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,639
Really?

169
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:30,772
What?

170
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,477
What is it? You tell me.

171
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,716
When I went to his house

172
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,889
his mother showed me
his yearbook.

173
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,222
His yearbook?

174
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,289
His junior high's

175
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,434
when he lived in Otaru.

176
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,705
There was a list of addresses

177
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,871
at the end of the book.

178
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,078
I found his address there.

179
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,743
I'm sure there was.

180
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,413
His house is no longer there.

181
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,282
A highway runs over it now.

182
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,185
Which means that address
doesn't exist anymore.

183
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,417
Right?

184
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,462
I guess so.

185
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,531
Guess what? I wrote a letter
and mailed it to that address.

186
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,902
I addressed it to him.

187
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,105
What for?

188
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,037
The letter won't get there.

189
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,207
That's why I mailed it.

190
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,382
It's a letter to Heaven.

191
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,925
You're really full of surprises.

192
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,397
But... guess what happened?

193
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,259
I got a reply.

194
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,797
From Heaven?

195
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,075
You must be kidding.

196
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:16,085
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko,
I'm basically fine..."

197
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,055
Isn't this strange?

198
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,483
"But I now have a cold.
- -Fujii Itsuki"

199
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,063
This must be a bad joke.

200
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,860
It could be...

201
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,730
But it makes me a bit happy.

202
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,105
It must be that.

203
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,579
You still can't forget Fujii.

204
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,747
That's why you wrote that.

205
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,116
And you, Akiba?
Have you forgotten him?

206
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,017
That's a different issue.

207
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,517
How do you define
our relationship?

208
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:58,592
Hey, Hiroko... hey...

209
00:19:59,097 --> 00:19:59,893
Hey.

210
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,224
I'm serious about this.

211
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,764
But I don't know.
How am I supposed to say?

212
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,505
Always this Kansai accent
when you're stuck.

213
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,502
Oh, hi. Is anything the matter?

214
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,663
I... I forgot something.

215
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,400
Forgot what?

216
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,840
Well... lt's all right. Goodbye.

217
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,477
She saw us kissing.

218
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,011
What shall we do?

219
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,380
It couldn't be helped.

220
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,888
We might as well
make it public now.

221
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,908
When I visited Fujii's grave

222
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,672
I asked for

223
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,044
his permission to marry you.

224
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:09,822
I think it's about time
you freed him.

225
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,927
Let yourself be free, too.

226
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,787
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

227
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,553
"On the way home today"

228
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,991
"I saw the cherry blossoms
were ready to bloom."

229
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,462
"Spring seems not far away.
- -Watanabe Hiroko"

230
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,863
She's deranged.

231
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,408
It's in Motojiro Kajii's story.

232
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,911
A body buried
under a cherry tree.

233
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,076
It's in Ango Sakaguchi's...

234
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,547
<i>Under the Full Bloom</i>
<i>Cherry Forest</i>.

235
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,517
That's it. That must be it.

236
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,521
There's a thing about
cherry blossoms.

237
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,186
That weird letter.

238
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,921
Those cold pills.

239
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,987
<i>The cherry blossoms</i>
<i>and spring not far away.</i>

240
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,363
She should be locked up.

241
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,127
It's scary. What shall I do?

242
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,265
If nothing's done about it
she'll keep on writing.

243
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,842
For how long?

244
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,245
Forever.

245
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,788
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

246
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,293
"Who in the world are you?"

247
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,933
"Please tell me the truth."

248
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,108
What the hell!

249
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,700
He's the one
who impersonated Fujii.

250
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,138
Suppose he's serious.

251
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,405
Serious in what way?

252
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,649
I don't know.

253
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,451
Come to think of it, it's weird.

254
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,224
Why was your letter delivered?

255
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,257
You said that
nobody lives at that address.

256
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,593
That it's a highway now.

257
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,090
But the letters are delivered.

258
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,998
Maybe he lives on the highway.

259
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,436
You're kidding.

260
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,969
What's going on anyway?

261
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,243
What's going on anyway?

262
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,716
Suppose he really does live
on the highway.

263
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,025
Assuming he does...

264
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:03,330
He lives in a hut
built on the median.

265
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,567
Suppose...

266
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,933
Just listen.

267
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:14,335
A postman comes to the address

268
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,974
but I'm sure he won't deliver
your letters to him.

269
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,039
Why won't he?

270
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,717
You can't live on a highway?

271
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,846
Wrong.

272
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,221
I said this is an assumption.

273
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,856
Let's put it this way.

274
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,587
Suppose the highway isn't there.

275
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,527
And Fujii's house is still there.

276
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,726
Suppose there's a new tenant.

277
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,736
And the postman comes
with the letter.

278
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,839
Will it be delivered?

279
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,271
Lt'll be delivered.

280
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,276
No, it won't.

281
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,405
Why not?

282
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,676
Why should it be?

283
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,513
The name's different.

284
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,577
Even if the address is right

285
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,987
if the nameplate is different.

286
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,952
I see.

287
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,583
Same with the highway.

288
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,959
Even if a house is
on the highway

289
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,759
if Mr. Yamada lives there

290
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,093
it won't be delivered.

291
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,225
If the name is different

292
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,293
the letter will never reach him.

293
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,304
That's how it works.

294
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:22,340
Which means...
He really is <i>Fujii Itsuki</i>.

295
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,710
That's hard to swallow.

296
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,340
His last name at least

297
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,751
has to be <i>Fujii</i>.

298
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,058
Say...

299
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:35,524
Suppose...

300
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,583
Wait a second.

301
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,353
Something may pop up.

302
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,127
No, that's not it.

303
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,069
What?

304
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,637
You see...
it's him writing the letters.

305
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,876
How else can you explain it?

306
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,944
That doesn't explain anything.

307
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,013
But it's romantic.

308
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,352
Sure it's romantic, but...

309
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,090
Let it rest at that.

310
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,221
No, we can't.

311
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,323
No, we can't, Hiroko.

312
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,127
All right.

313
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,135
All right.
You believe what you like.

314
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:26,007
I'll concentrate on
finding out the truth.

315
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,877
Lend it to me.

316
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,974
It's precious evidence.

317
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,353
"If you are
the real Fujii Itsuki"

318
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,920
"kindly show me some proof."

319
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,149
Is she picking a fight?

320
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,162
She's the one
who wrote to me first.

321
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,032
Send her some kind of proof.

322
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,828
What?

323
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:50,925
The proof.

324
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,492
What kind of proof?

325
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,001
A copy of your resident card?

326
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,536
Why do I have to
take such trouble?

327
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,804
Health insurance card?

328
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:07,448
I've decided not to be involved
in this nonsense anymore.

329
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,947
She can just keep on writing.

330
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,390
Hey.

331
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,625
She's calling you a fake.

332
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,772
My God. It looks like a mug shot.

333
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,665
Incredible. It's a girl.

334
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,338
So there really is
another Fujii Itsuki.

335
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,077
My strategy
really worked out well.

336
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,810
To tell you the truth,
I secretly wrote to her.

337
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,548
"If you claim to be Fujii Itsuki,
send me some proof."

338
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,586
She <i>really</i> did.

339
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,255
Copied her driver's license.

340
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,732
Hiroko, why don't you

341
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,168
accompany me to Otaru?

342
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,138
A friend of mine in Otaru
also works with glass.

343
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,005
He's holding
an exhibition there.

344
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,634
I wasn't thinking of going

345
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,805
but it's a good chance.

346
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,678
Let's go to Otaru

347
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,116
and unmask this girl.

348
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,854
She's not our enemy.

349
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,924
It's not what I wanted.

350
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,288
Why did you do it?

351
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,833
Well, this is it.

352
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,699
It's all over.

353
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,508
THIS IS THE PROOF.
DON'T EVER WRITE TO ME AGAIN.

354
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:45,947
GOODBYE - - FUJll ITSUKI

355
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,311
Hope she got well.

356
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,049
Hope she took those pills.

357
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,787
Hiroko.

358
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,763
The letter was from <i>him</i>.

359
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,529
I wanted to believe that.

360
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,240
But it's all over now.

361
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,344
It's all because of the letters.

362
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,056
It can't be him!

363
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,161
How can he write a letter?

364
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,100
That's cruel, Hiroko.

365
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,364
You always sit there.

366
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,469
You sat there
when Fujii and you first met.

367
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,016
He asked you to go out with him.

368
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,381
Remember that?

369
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,910
<i>I</i> wanted to ask you out.

370
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,749
He had never spoken
to a girl until then.

371
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,655
I should've made my move first.

372
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,795
If I had done so

373
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,163
how would it have turned out?

374
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,245
Let's go to Otaru.

375
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,957
Let's find the other...

376
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,854
the other Fujii Itsuki.

377
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,327
Found it.

378
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,420
It's this way.

379
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,831
It's close by.

380
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,506
He'll be right over.

381
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,945
Is it really you, Akiba?

382
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,246
It's been a long time.

383
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,150
You haven't changed at all.

384
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,651
Fujii's... fiancee?

385
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,958
I see.

386
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,856
Did you know him?

387
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,629
Of course. I did.

388
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,627
I knew enough about Fujii.

389
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,493
It was a small college.

390
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,327
Didn't know he was from Otaru.

391
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,937
Neither did I.

392
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,128
Yoshida.

393
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,174
This Fujii...

394
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,073
Do you mean Fujii Itsuki?

395
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,374
Did you know him?

396
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,047
Of course I did.

397
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,215
I knew him since childhood.

398
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,878
It's a small town.

399
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,443
Are you having a relapse?

400
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,913
I'm not going to work.

401
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,945
Then you must go to the hospital.

402
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,586
Good morning.

403
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:45,553
Yes.

404
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,121
Mr. Abekasu?

405
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,551
He found a new flat for us.

406
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,251
Can't I go, too?

407
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,087
Seeing the flat won't hurt.

408
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:00,900
Too early?

409
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,097
No, it's all right.

410
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,864
Ah... yes.

411
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,867
Itsuki.

412
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,173
Can you leave soon?

413
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,984
Is grandpa still against it?

414
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,713
He's digging up the garden.

415
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,051
He was even planting something.

416
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,113
He probably wants to stay there.

417
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,719
We can't give way to
an old man's nostalgia.

418
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,786
You said the ceiling
will cave in soon.

419
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,559
Yes, that's for sure.

420
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,726
It's amazing you're living there.

421
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,736
Can't be that bad.

422
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,670
Well, I didn't mean it to be...

423
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,539
Hey, this is too warm.

424
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:43,905
Keep it on.

425
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,744
You shouldn't
underestimate a cold.

426
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,609
Do you know Marimo Store?

427
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:49,750
Opposite Marusho?

428
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,449
Yes. The owner there
is a client of ours.

429
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,150
He neglected a cold.

430
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,216
He almost never had a cold.

431
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,421
So we all teased him about it.

432
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,191
It developed into pneumonia.

433
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,025
He died?

434
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,000
Come on.
You don't die of pneumonia.

435
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,997
My dad died of that.

436
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,406
Of pneumonia?
Did he really die of that?

437
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,066
Yes, he neglected a cold.

438
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,142
Remember?

439
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,337
Well... yes... I do...
That's how it happened...

440
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,811
How long ago was it?

441
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,850
Did you forget that, too.

442
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,847
He was your wife's brother.

443
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,116
People are easily forgotten

444
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,454
when they die.

445
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,994
What can I say...

446
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,664
Her father died of pneumonia.

447
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,176
She should know better.

448
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,551
What's this place?

449
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,217
The hospital.

450
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,659
I should have known better.
This is Route 5.

451
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,575
When did it open?

452
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,846
We went to different junior highs.

453
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,850
I didn't know he moved.

454
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,143
Must have been the entrance.

455
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,243
Rattle, rattle.

456
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,153
Excuse me...

457
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:39,624
Mr. Ohtomo, do you know
someone else named Fujii?

458
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,031
The same name as Fujii.

459
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,068
I don't seem to recall.

460
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,104
Hiroko, what are you doing?

461
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,081
I mailed it here.

462
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,748
My first letter.

463
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,883
Mrs. Hosoi. Mrs. Hosoi Taki.

464
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,580
Miss Fujii.

465
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,420
Miss Fujii Itsuki.

466
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,792
Dad...

467
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,172
Itsuki.

468
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,182
Hurry up.

469
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,533
Miss Fujii Itsuki.

470
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,464
Miss Fujii.

471
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,839
Isn't Fujii Itsuki here?

472
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,005
Here.

473
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,886
Must be around here.

474
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,163
Let's ask someone.

475
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,140
FUJII

476
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,573
Excuse me...

477
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,213
Don't worry.

478
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,414
Nobody'll think we're strange.

479
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,622
Excuse me...

480
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,588
Excuse me...

481
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,764
Does Fujii Itsuki live here?

482
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,563
She does.

483
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,273
Is this Fujii Itsuki's residence?

484
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,345
She's out now.

485
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,382
I see.

486
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,584
She should be back soon.

487
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,188
Can we wait for her outside?

488
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,925
Wait inside.

489
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,492
No, we'll wait for her outside.

490
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,174
We're pretty crazy, aren't we?

491
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,022
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

492
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,560
"I came to Otaru to meet you."

493
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:14,398
"I am writing this letter
in front of your house."

494
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,639
"The Fujii Itsuki I knew"

495
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,574
"wasn't you."

496
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,872
"I realized that coming here."

497
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,544
"My Fujii Itsuki was a man."

498
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,316
"He was my fiance."

499
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,326
"Two years ago, he..."

500
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,679
Let's go.

501
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:07,985
Not wait?

502
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,850
No.

503
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,301
"I don't know where he is now."

504
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,272
"I sometimes think about him."

505
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,234
"I just hope
he's doing well somewhere."

506
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,040
Oh, this is useless.

507
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,447
It's a small town.

508
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,283
The station won't be far.

509
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,155
"That's why I wrote that letter."

510
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,156
"It wasn't supposed to be
delivered at all."

511
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:54,800
Say...

512
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:01,501
You lied in that letter.

513
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,008
I lied?

514
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,840
You didn't tell her he died.

515
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,017
I wonder why I didn't.

516
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,687
Didn't feel up to it.

517
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,755
Death isn't so pretty.

518
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,260
Not so pretty, huh?

519
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,268
Maybe you're right.

520
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,031
We're in luck.

521
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,135
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

522
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:40,646
"I'm writing this letter
in front of your house."

523
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,386
I saw you waiting
for a cab back there.

524
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,321
I dropped a passenger

525
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,291
and made a U-turn
to pick you up.

526
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,793
That's considerate.

527
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:58,931
You look like that passenger
who was just on my cab.

528
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,627
What? Me?

529
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,172
No, the lady next to you.

530
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,399
Could pass as twins.

531
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,841
"I must have caused
a lot of trouble."

532
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,441
"I am truly sorry."

533
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:19,055
"I wanted to meet the person
with the same name as my fiance."

534
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,718
"But I didn't have the courage."

535
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,593
"Our sole link was
the correspondence."

536
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,327
"And it may be best
to leave it as that."

537
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,263
The same name...

538
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,948
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

539
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,019
"I sent that rude letter"

540
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,461
"because I had no idea
who you were."

541
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,254
"Please forgive me."

542
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,368
"To make up for it"

543
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,938
"I have a piece of information."

544
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,721
Be free to
come over again any time.

545
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,123
Come back to Kobe for a change.

546
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,252
You speak funny now.

547
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,192
Do I?

548
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,524
How's Nakamura doing?

549
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,394
Nakamura? No news from him?

550
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,593
He doesn't even call me anymore.

551
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,794
I'll tell him

552
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,268
to call you sometimes.

553
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,462
Any cigarettes?

554
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,937
Sorry. No cigarettes.

555
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,673
Miss Fujii.

556
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,083
"To make up for it"

557
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,621
"I have a piece of information."

558
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,887
"When I was
a junior high school student"

559
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,655
"there was a boy in my class
with the same name."

560
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,730
"Fujii Itsuki you referred to"

561
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,859
"could be that boy."

562
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,791
This is it. Up there.

563
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,787
On the third floor.

564
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,756
It has quite a good view.

565
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,425
So small.

566
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,438
Itsuki, compared to that
huge house anywhere is too small.

567
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,142
True. We don't use
three of the rooms.

568
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:26,972
I told you.

569
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,476
Maybe we should get a boarder.

570
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:33,073
Please. You won't
be able to move out.

571
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,516
You don't want us canceling

572
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,417
at the last moment again.

573
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,781
I'm not concerned about that.

574
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,826
Must decide quickly.

575
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,123
I have clients waiting to see it.

576
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,820
The decision is made.

577
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:52,293
All we have to do
is persuade grandpa.

578
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:58,908
You know it has to be
torn down in a few years.

579
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,936
I'II decide on that.

580
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,379
I'm against it.

581
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,509
Would you please sit down?

582
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,347
Sit down and listen.

583
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,649
I got your point.

584
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,554
No, you don't.

585
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,690
Will my opposing it

586
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,398
change anything?

587
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,632
No, it won't.

588
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,475
Then we're moving
to a new place.

589
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,013
Senile goat.

590
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,749
What?

591
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,744
Did he said <i>we're moving</i>?

592
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,452
What're you looking for?
You look so serious.

593
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,020
Oh, nothing really.

594
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,934
Did he have a classmate
with the same name?

595
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:10,045
I don't really know.
Was there such person?

596
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:15,818
This girl.

597
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,215
Let me see.

598
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,520
I don't remember her.

599
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,997
Does this girl look like me?

600
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,863
Do we look alike?

601
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,772
Like you, Hiroko?

602
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,042
I wonder.

603
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,813
Does it matter?

604
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,451
If you look alike,
does it matter?

605
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,850
Well, not really.

606
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,013
You're lying.

607
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,715
No, I'm not.

608
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,226
Hiroko.

609
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,154
Your face says you're lying.

610
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,395
Suppose you do look alike.

611
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,466
If so...

612
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,169
I can't forgive him.

613
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:23,116
If that was the reason
why he chose me...

614
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,589
Mrs. Fujii,
how am I supposed to take it?

615
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,859
He said it was
love at first sight.

616
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,691
And I believed him.

617
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,138
But there was a reason behind

618
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,607
his <i>his love at first sight</i> for me.

619
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,303
He fooled me all along.

620
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:55,315
Hiroko, are you trying to compete
with this junior high girl?

621
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,217
Yes, I am. Is that funny?

622
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,093
Yes, it really is.

623
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,855
I guess you're right.

624
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,369
What a lucky boy he was.

625
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,329
Making you jealous
after he's gone.

626
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:22,143
You still love him, don't you?

627
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,275
Don't say that.
You're making me cry.

628
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,195
"How are you?"

629
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,757
"The <i>Fujii Itsuki</i> you mentioned
and my <i>Fujii Itsuki</i>"

630
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,534
"were the same person."

631
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,067
"I found your address"

632
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:54,371
"in his junior high yearbook."

633
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,942
"It's all because
I'm such a flake."

634
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,041
"I'm really sorry."

635
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,614
"I know..."

636
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:07,020
"I know
I've caused you enough trouble"

637
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,527
"but could I ask a favor of you?"

638
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,860
"If there is anything
you remember about him"

639
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,091
"would you let me know?"

640
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,861
I remember him <i>very</i> well.

641
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,029
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

642
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,032
"I do remember
a lot of things about him."

643
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,372
"But most of my memories"

644
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,745
"are about our names"

645
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,884
"I'm sure you have
an idea what they are."

646
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,487
"Sorry to say they are not
very pleasant memories."

647
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:44,152
"It began on the 1st day
of the school year."

648
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,466
Shoji Katsutoshi.

649
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:56,402
Here.

650
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,834
Tanaka Kyosuke.

651
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,839
Here.

652
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,642
Hattori Kazutomo.

653
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,609
Here.

654
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,376
Fujii Itsuki.

655
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,414
- -Here.
- -Here.

656
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,545
Same name?

657
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,990
It's incredible.

658
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,922
Muraoka Shinobu.

659
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:19,452
Muraoka.

660
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,191
"My junior high school period"

661
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,199
"had such a bad start."

662
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,600
"Because of him, I had to
endure 3 depressive years"

663
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,298
"filled with unfair prejudice."

664
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,935
"When I was on <i>day duty</i>..."

665
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:50,154
Fujii, who's on
<i>day duty</i> tomorrow?

666
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,494
Muraoka and Funabashi.

667
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,195
What did we do in Math today?

668
00:53:58,868 --> 00:53:59,960
Equations.

669
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,567
Which equations?

670
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,002
Fujii Itsuki.

671
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,269
You love birds having fun?

672
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,077
Sorry for the intrusion.

673
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,009
Love is wonderful, isn't it?

674
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,310

675
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,774
Thanks.

676
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,755
"I thought all this hassle
was only for a year."

677
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:25,284
"But we ended up
in the same class for 3 years."

678
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,756
"It may sound fun
for an outsider"

679
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:31,834
"But not
when you're a part of it."

680
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,298
"We somehow avoided each other"

681
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,096
"and didn't talk much, either."

682
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,773
What's new since then?

683
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,539
The letter.

684
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,576
Well, on and off.

685
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,646
What do you mean <i>on and off</i>?

686
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,123
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

687
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,718
"How did he take it?"

688
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,219
"Having the same name"

689
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,391
"didn't he feel
you two were bound by destiny?"

690
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,667
"That was out of question."

691
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,573
"You may think
there was a romantic flavoring"

692
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:16,075
"but reality had
no such tenderness."

693
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,706
"Because of our names"

694
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,774
"we were constantly
exposed to mockery and torture."

695
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,521
"For 3 years, we never had
even a single moment of peace."

696

"The class officers' election"

697
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,785
"was almost a nightmare."

698
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:33,988
Endo.

"Among the ballots
was this ridiculous graffiti."

FUJll ITSUKI? FUJII ITSUKI

701
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:45,137
"When they counted the ballots.
Inaba kindly read it out."

702
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,975
Fujii Itsuki...
heart... Fujii Itsuki.

703
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,016
"And it didn't end there."

704
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,119
"After the officers' election"

705
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,090
"came the special committees."

706
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,887
"Like the radio committee."

707
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,292
"First was the library committee."

708
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,954
"I sensed something bad."

709
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:23,339
The Fujii Itsuki couple
will be in the library committee.

710
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:34,613
Hey, look at her. She's crying.

711
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,789
She's crying.

712
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:41,788
Really?

713
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:42,422
She is.

714
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,637
What's wrong with him?

715
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,116
Love is indestructible.

716
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,511
You heard that?

717
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:07,690
Sorry.

718
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,718
It's a joke.

719
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,921
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it. Hold it.
No big deal. It's no big deal.

720
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,134
Stop it.

721
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,429
You bastard.

722
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,096
Stop it. Fujii.

723
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,899
Fujii, let him go.

724
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,876
Stop it.

725
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,905
Everybody. Stop them.

726
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,744
Stop it. Fujii.

727
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,721
"Despite his resistance"

728
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,917
"we were both sent to the library."

729
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,993
"But he just goofed around"

730
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,394
"and didn't do any work."

731
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,029
Fujii...

732
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,364
make yourself useful.

733
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,777
"He kept on borrowing books."

734
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,721
"Like biography of Konyo Aoki"

735
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,452
"or Mallarme's poetry."

736
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:54,359
"He borrowed books
no one else would"

737
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,761
You're reading these?

738
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,263
Of course not.

Fujii Itsuki <i>Straight Flash</i>.

"on blank cards
with no other names."

743

"I was appalled and said..."

744
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,657
What a jerk.

745
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:30,622
"But he really seemed to
enjoy this mischief."

746

"And he kept at it."

747
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,168

"<i>Give me back my answer sheet</i>."

Kazumi wants to go out with you.

Waiting for someone, too?

Life's tough, huh?

789
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,136
Boys are so selfish.

790
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,198
Don't you agree?

791
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,251
Go ahead... use this.

Thank you.

793
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,707
But...

794
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:37,036
But girls may be more selfish.

795
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,615
Good luck.

01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,382

01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,980
Hey, Fujii.

800
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,188
You've got my answer sheet.

801
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,829
Isn't this yours?

802
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,802
It's dark. I can't see.

803
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,338
Would you hurry up.

804
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,280
My hands are getting tired.

805
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:55,019
The past tense of <i>break</i> is <i>broke</i>.

806
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,289
Hey.

807
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,988
This is no time
to correct your paper.

808
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,363
I can't see.

809
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,282
Found it.

810
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,126
What is this?

811
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,394
It's disgusting.

812
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,401
"I found that answer sheet,
so I'll send it to you."

813
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,472
"He drew that thing in the back."

814
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,673
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

815
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:52,336

816
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,040
"Thank you."

817
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,584
"By the way,
what kind of girl did he like?"

818
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:02,982
"Do you happen to know
who was his first love?"

819
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,287
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

820
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:09,460
"I do not know the details"

821
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:10,999
"of his personal life."

822
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,800
But I remember
he was quite popular.

823
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,404
"Do you remember Oikawa Sanae?"

824
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,966
"She got me into trouble."

825
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,534
Itsuki.

826
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:28,180
Do you know who
Fujii is going out with?

827
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,514
How should I know?

828
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:33,912
Really?

829
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,957
What does that mean?

830
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:39,523
Well, you seem to be
chummy with him.

831
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,426
You must be kidding.

832
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,431
Why should I be?

833
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,969
Don't you feel
anything for him?

834
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:51,238
I could be
a matchmaker for you two.

835
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,967
No, thank you.

836
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,343
Get into pairs.

837
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,647
Start the back-to-back
calisthenics.

838
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:13,122
So you really weren't
going out with him.

839
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,220
Didn't I say so.

840
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,900
I asked him directly.

841
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:26,531
I was ready to be
your matchmaker.

842
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,178
It's such a pity.

843
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,177
In that case

844
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:38,143
it's your turn to be
the matchmaker for me.

845
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,811
What do you mean?

846
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,325
I want you to be

847
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,361
a go -between for him and me.

848
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,695
What're you saying?

849
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,333
Don't you think

850
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,597
I'm pretty unpredictable?

851
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,995
Oikawa Sanae wants
to be friends with you.

852
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,765
Is that so.

853
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,397
Isn't it great?

854
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,636
Really.

855
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,678
What're you going to do?

856
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,573
Nothing... really.

857
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,505
Don't you like her?

858
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,051
Is there someone else?

859
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:00,057
Isn't there?

860
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,659
There isn't.

861
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,604
Then say <i>yes</i>.

862
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,604
Hey, wait a minute.

863
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,276
Let me catch my breath first.

864
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,875
Wait a minute.

865
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:23,190
Wait. Wait.

866
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,759
You don't need to
come any further.

867
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,835
A boy and girl story
is a repetition of this.

868
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,014
"So I can say"

869
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:24,678
"that Sanae was not
his girlfriend."

870
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:26,012
"Anyway"

871
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:30,319
"he was so unfriendly
he didn't deserve a girlfriend."

872
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:34,488
"Sorry. This was what I
thought of him in those days."

873
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,083
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko.
I have a question."

874
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:03,423
"What did you see in him?"

875
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,286
Sorry to keep you waiting.

876
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,992
Mr. Akiba will soon be here.

877
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,699
Miss Watanabe.

878
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:20,939
I was in love with Mr. Akiba.

879
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:25,336
I gave him up because of you.

880
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,678
I like you, too.

881
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,454
Please make Mr. Akiba happy.

882
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,221
No...

883
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,026
He should make you happy.

884
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,291
I'll tell him that.

885
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:52,340
Mr. Akiba, Miss Watanabe
has been waiting for you.

886
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:58,376
<i>The blue wind</i>

887
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,815
<i>come and run</i>

888
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:07,079
<i>to that island</i>.

889
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:13,927
Say... why don't we <i>go</i>
to that mountain once.

890
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:23,499
Let's go talk to him.

891
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,031
Let's do it.

892
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,988
Help me out here.

893
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,494
Don't feel good. Count me out.

894
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,130
That cold sure is persistent.

895
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:55,134
"Memories keep popping up."

896
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,972
"I also remember this."

897
01:12:56,972 --> 01:13:00,100
"He was hit by a truck
on the way to school."

898
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,143
"An ambulance took him."

899
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:05,145
"It was hilarious at school."

900
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:09,678
Fujii Itsuki had
an accident this morning.

901
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,778
We don't know the details.

902
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,379
Miss Hamaguchi
went to the hospital.

903
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,322
So, I'll be
in charge of today's homeroom.

904
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,332
Fujii, why are you here?

905
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:30,362
Study hour.

906
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,205
What was that about?

907
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,115
"His left leg had
a compound fracture."

908
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,378
"It was a month before
the school track meet."

909
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,647
"He was to run
in the 100 meter race."

910
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:09,301
Course 1, lkeda.

911
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:15,516
Course 2, Taguchi.

912
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,683
Come on.

913
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,288
Look at this camera.

914
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:25,553
Can you see?

915
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,336
On your mark.

916
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:53,252
Ready.

917
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,115
Who are you?

918
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,319
Where are you from?

919
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,427
Which school?

920
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:43,870
Who the hell is he?

921
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,429
I demand a re -start.

922
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,439
He's ruining the race.

923
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,003
What's he up to anyway?

924
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,672
How do you focus it?

925
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,683
Didn't you see that?

926
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,150
What happened?

927
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,922
"That became"

928
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:06,427
"his last sprint
in his junior high years."

929
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,490
You're home today?

930
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,125
Hey, don't barge in like this.

931
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,836
It's an exception today.

932
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,904
No exceptions allowed.

933
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,130
This is for you.

934
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,767
Sign it, please.

935
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,714
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

936
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,790
"Please take pictures"

937
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,722
"of the ground he ran on."

938
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,725
Can I help you?

939
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,498
What are you looking for?

940
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:34,574
Miss Hamaguchi...

941
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,104
I was in your 3rd Year Class 2.

942
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:41,039
Fujii?

943
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,184
Yes.

944
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,208
Do you remember me?

945
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,687
Fujii Itsuki. 3rd Year Class 2.

946
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,346
Your attendance number was...

947
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:55,553
Aizawa, Okazaki, Kato, Koyama,
Sato, Sato, Shoji, Hattori...

948
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,566
Ito, Endo, Kanzaki,
Suzuki, Tsuchiya, Nakajima...

949
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,728
Number 24.

950
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:04,996
Wow. How could you?

951
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:09,303
So you work
at the Municipal Library?

952
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,172
Funny I ended up working there.

953
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,811
Your library duty wasn't wasted.

954
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:17,181
I really enjoyed that.

955
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,155
We're putting the books in order.

956
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,458
Wow. I sure miss all this.

957
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:27,927
Come here, everyone.

958
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:40,007
This is our graduate, Miss Fujii.

959
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,102
Hello.

960
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,136
Hear that? She's Fujii.

961
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:49,979
Miss Fujii Itsuki.

962
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,618
You know her?

963
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,754
Far out!

964
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,696
There's a game we play.

965
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,928
We call it
<i>Looking for Fujii Itsuki</i>.

966
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,667
Who found it first?

967
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:12,830
Kubota did.

968
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,302
Then we found many more books.

969
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,677
We compete to see

970
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,873
who can find the most books.

971
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:23,549
We even made a score chart.

972
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,509
Where did we put that?

973
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,518
The craze cooled off now.

974
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,314
How many did we find?

975
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,722
Let me see...

976
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,125
So far... we've found 87.

977
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:36,794
Did you find so many?

978
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:41,466
But we never thought we'd be
able to meet her in person.

979
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,969
I didn't write
these library cards.

980
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,734
A friend of mine
did it for kicks.

981
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:51,179
Was that a boy?

982
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:53,543
Yes.

983
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:58,184
That boy... He must have
liked you a lot.

984
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:02,883
Because he wrote
your name so many times.

985
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:08,259
Were you going out with him?

986
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,756
You've got it all wrong.

987
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,598
These are not my names.

988
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,099
They're not.

989
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:22,035
It's so romantic. I envy you.

990
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,349
They sure put me in a spot.

991
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,043
Aren't they something?

992
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,211
I put up with them everyday.

993
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,787
That's true.

994
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,416
Who was it?

995
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,124
The boy who liked you?

996
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,862
Who wrote all the cards?

997
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,363
Please, Miss Hamaguchi.

998
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,160
Oh, come on.

999
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,060
That wasn't my name.

1000
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,971
Remember?
There was another Fujii Itsuki.

1001
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,442
What? You mean that boy?

1002
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,433
It was his doing.

1003
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:00,340
Remember his attendance number?

1004
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,507
Nine.

1005
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,577
Terrific.

1006
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,415
It was no more than a second.

1007
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,019
He became a very special boy.

1008
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,817
Didn't he die 2 years ago?

1009
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,023
During mountain climbing.

1010
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:53,356
It's hot.

1011
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,072
One more station to go.

1012
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:41,134
What is it?

1013
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,702
A dragon -fly.

1014
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,654
Dad died, didn't he?

1015
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,511
A friend of mine lives near here.

1016
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,312
His name is Kaji

1017
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,014
so everybody calls him <i>Kaji Bear</i>.

1018
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:31,625
He's fierce as a bear.

1019
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,522
That's why he calls him that.

1020
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:38,490
We'll stay
at his place tonight and

1021
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:40,864
go to mountain in the morning.

1022
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,535
Look. It's over there.

1023
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,364
You can see the mountain top.

1024
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:51,834
What's the matter?

1025
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,572
I can't.

1026
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,050
I just can't.

1027
01:25:58,786 --> 01:25:59,844
Hiroko.

1028
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,721
What are we doing?

1029
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,352
This can't be right.

1030
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,688
It can't be right.

1031
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,699
Hiroko.

1032
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,265
He'll be angry.

1033
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:17,938
He won't be.

1034
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,495
Let's go home.

1035
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:24,875
We came all the way

1036
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:26,607
to put aside the past.

1037
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,815
Please.

1038
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,747
You must put it aside, Hiroko.

1039
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,178
Please...

1040
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:36,346
Let me go home.

1041
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,761
DEAR WATANABE HIROKO

1042
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,932
MY DAD NEGLECTED
A COLD, AND DIED.

1043
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,771
What's wrong?

1044
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:03,540
Did you check your temperature?

1045
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,141
It's broken.

1046
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:06,854
Let me see.

1047
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,517
Itsuki.

1048
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,161
Itsuki.

1049
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,097
41.8 degrees?

1050
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:25,901
Grandpa.

1051
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,569
Grandpa.

1052
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:33,678
Grandpa.

1053
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,881
Call the ambulance.

1054
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,518
And please bring a blanket.

1055
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:50,725
Grandpa, the blanket.

1056
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,658
Itsuki.

1057
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:55,666
Grandpa, the blanket.

1058
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,464
Did you call 119?

1059
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,629
The blanket?

1060
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,373
The ambulance first.

1061
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,000
And Itsuki?

1062
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,777
I'll carry her.

1063
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:05,001
But...

1064
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:06,910
Just call 119.

1065
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:14,479
I'm cold... l'm cold.

1066
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:19,556
One hour? What nonsense
are you talking about?

1067
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,821
Why would it take that long?

1068
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:25,528
What? The snow?

1069
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:35,570
The ambulance?

1070
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,243
Can't wait.

1071
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:39,174
Grandpa.

1072
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,872
Bring the blanket.

1073
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:42,508
What're you doing?

1074
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:44,517
If we catch a cab

1075
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,849
it's 15 minutes to the hospital.

1076
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,186
The taxi's not good.

1077
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:58,192
Can't catch any.

1078
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,927
In that case, I'll walk.

1079
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,662
Are you out for your mind?

1080
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,068
You can't do that.

1081
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:05,728
Call the ambulance.

1082
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,037
They say it takes one hour.

1083
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,007
What?

1084
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:10,902
Why?

1085
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:12,707
Look outside.

1086
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,318
Where's the blanket?

1087
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:30,925
Hello... hello...

1088
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:34,333
This is Fujii. We called before.

1089
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:35,536
Yes...

1090
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:40,365
Yes, we are. We're using ice
to lower the temperature.

1091
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:43,340
Who are you talking to?

1092
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:46,039
Grandpa, lay Itsuki on the sofa.

1093
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,173
We must keep her warm.

1094
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,149
And would you...

1095
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,213
Hey.

1096
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:54,288
Grandpa, I asked you
to lay Itsuki on the sofa.

1097
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,720
Must warm her.

1098
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,314
They told me that.

1099
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:58,790
Then do as they say.

1100
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,852
That won't make
the ambulance come.

1101
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,464
They say it's coming.

1102
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:05,863
In about an hour.

1103
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:10,393
Look. It's getting worse.

1104
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:13,300
It'll be even worse.

1105
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,703
One hour, right?

1106
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:20,407
One hour.

1107
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:26,149
Please wait a second.

1108
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,481
Grandpa. Put her down.

1109
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:30,750
Bring the blanket.

1110
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:32,155
Not the taxi.

1111
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:33,693
Hurry up and bring it.

1112
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:35,558
Want to kill her, too?

1113
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,269
Get hold of yourself.

1114
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,405
Remember the last time?

1115
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,812
You ignored 119

1116
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,781
and went to find a taxi.

1117
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,045
You couldn't get a taxi.

1118
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,749
Carried him on your back

1119
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:05,155
and walked to the hospital.

1120
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:06,386
Don't you remember?

1121
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,087
The treatment was delayed

1122
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:13,190
and that's how he died.

1123
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:17,295
Why do you want to repeat that?

1124
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:19,334
At a time like this

1125
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:22,537
we must listen
to the specialists.

1126
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,410
You understand, don't you?

1127
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:35,648
How long did it take
to the hospital that time?

1128
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:39,454
How many minutes?

1129
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,593
One hour.

1130
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,464
At least one hour.

1131
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:47,825
Not that long.

1132
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,492
It took that long.

1133
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:52,337
It was 40 minutes.

1134
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,335
It took 40 minutes that time.

1135
01:31:58,412 --> 01:31:59,606
It was no longer than that.

1136
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:01,605
No, it was 40 minutes.

1137
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:07,045
To be precise,
to the hospital entrance

1138
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:09,088
it was exactly 38 minutes.

1139
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:14,190
But it was too late.

1140
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:18,627
Either way
he wouldn't have made it.

1141
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,729
If we leave here now

1142
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:29,202
We'll reach the hospital
before the ambulance comes.

1143
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:32,337
Your decision.

1144
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,746
Itsuki is your daughter.

1145
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:38,975
<i>You</i> must decide.

1146
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:50,491
But it's impossible
to walk in this snow.

1147
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:55,392
I will not <i>walk</i>; I will <i>run</i>.

1148
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:08,046
We'll stay one night here.

1149
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,314
Okay?

1150
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,388
Hi, there, Akiba.

1151
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,524
What happened to your face?

1152
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:25,230
I told you he looks like a bear.

1153
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:35,404
His death is a loss to us all.

1154
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:38,771
I wonder why
good guys always die young.

1155
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:42,481
Kaji Bear was in the party, too

1156
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:43,983
when that accident took place.

1157
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:47,680
I had more hair
at the time, though.

1158
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:50,188
You definitely had more hair.

1159
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,024
He's a great guy.

1160
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:55,727
Since the accident

1161
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:57,787
he looks after the climbers here.

1162
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:01,592
Because of the accident

1163
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:04,729
I've become an expert
on that mountain.

1164
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:10,266
But since I tell the climbers
where to be careful or

1165
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:12,437
not to ignore the weather

1166
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,344
they find me annoying.

1167
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:16,507
You're a great guy.

1168
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,542
I ran away from the mountain.

1169
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,918
Don't you want to climb again?

1170
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:26,849
No, it's impossible.

1171
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:28,528
How come?

1172
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:30,858
I'm just...

1173
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:34,794
...scared.

1174
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:49,049
Hey.

1175
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:54,747
<i>My love runs</i>

1176
01:34:56,057 --> 01:35:03,395
<i>on the south wind</i>

1177
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,090
What is this song?

1178
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,863
Is it your club song
or something?

1179
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:12,335
He sang this before he died.

1180
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,941
He fell into a ravine.

1181
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:19,169
We couldn't see him

1182
01:35:20,314 --> 01:35:22,839
but we heard him singing.

1183
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:27,620
Of all the songs in the world,
why did it have to be this?

1184
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,324
He didn't even
like Seiko Matsuda.

1185
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:34,822
He was a strange one.

1186
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:36,021
He sure was.

1187
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:49,843
You know, he never
asked me to marry him.

1188
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:57,715
He called me to Mt. Maya.

1189
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:01,652
He had the engagement ring
in his hand.

1190
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:04,686
But he didn't say anything.

1191
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:09,689
We stayed there without a word

1192
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,198
for about two hours.

1193
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:18,364
I began to feel sorry for him.

1194
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,634
So I ended up

1195
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:26,212
asking him to marry me.

1196
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:30,149
Then he said one word.

1197
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:31,782
<i>Okay</i>.

1198
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,717
That's the way he was.

1199
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:44,288
He was hopeless
in front of girls.

1200
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:48,558
They're all good memories.

1201
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:50,364
That's true.

1202
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:54,333
He gave me lots of good memories.

1203
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:57,503
You're right.

1204
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:03,916
But I want more from him.

1205
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,920
I pester him after his death

1206
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:14,358
and beg for more.

1207
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:19,692
I'm such a selfish girl.

1208
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,137
But grandpa.

1209
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:31,305
It's 10 years since then.

1210
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,403
So? What's the problem?

1211
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,482
You're 75 this year.

1212
01:37:35,549 --> 01:37:37,380
No, 76.

1213
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:38,982
You can't do it.

1214
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:41,145
Age has nothing to do with it.

1215
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:42,654
Yes, it does.

1216
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:46,659
Grandpa.

1217
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:49,858
It's impossible.

1218
01:37:58,305 --> 01:37:59,329
Wait.

1219
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:01,906
Please wait.

1220
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,547
Don't worry.

1221
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,052
Even if it costs me my life

1222
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:19,181
I'll get there within 40 minutes.

1223
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,602
This patient...

1224
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:31,968
The oxygen.

1225
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:55,325
Akiko.

1226
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:59,758
We're not
moving out of the house.

1227
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:03,202
I'm absolutely sure.

1228
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:07,266
Whether it's our grandpa

1229
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:11,876
or the house, I'll stay and
witness which falls first.

1230
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:15,342
As a real estate agent I guarantee

1231
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:17,247
the house'll fall first.

1232
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:18,376
Don't worry, Akiko.

1233
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:19,918
They'll both be okay.

1234
01:39:22,056 --> 01:39:23,023
Hiroko.

1235
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:31,661
Hiroko.

1236
01:39:35,569 --> 01:39:36,900
What is it?

1237
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,268
Come and take a look.

1238
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,573
It's such a beautiful dawn.

1239
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,127
What?

1240
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:03,956
See it?

1241
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:05,721
See what?

1242
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:10,132
That's the mountain.

1243
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:21,043
Take a good look.

1244
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:23,245
Fujii is there.

1245
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:46,199
Fujii.

1246
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:49,998
Are you still singing
that Seiko Matsuda song?

1247
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:57,674
Aren't you cold up there?

1248
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:04,454
I'm taking Hiroko from you.

1249
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,322
Go ahead.

1250
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:09,452
Go ahead.

1251
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,469
He says <i>go ahead</i>.

1252
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,728
That's cheating, Akiba.

1253
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:23,399
Hiroko, say something to him.

1254
01:41:25,212 --> 01:41:27,271
Must have a lot of complaints.

1255
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:28,314
Go on.

1256
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:27,774
How are you?

1257
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:34,980
I'm very well.

1258
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:46,457
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

1259
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,965
"How are you?"

1260
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:55,358
How are you?

1261
01:42:56,303 --> 01:43:00,672
"I'm very well."

1262
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:06,138
I'm very well.

1263
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,914
"How are you?"

1264
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:11,780
How are you?

1265
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:13,645
"I'm..."

1266
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,287
I'm very well.

1267
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,888
"How are you?"

1268
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:23,587
How are you?

1269
01:43:24,932 --> 01:43:28,231
I'm very well.

1270
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:33,532
How are you?

1271
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:47,744
What's this racket?

1272
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:50,450
At this early hour.

1273
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:54,055
Don't interrupt her.

1274
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,588
This is the best part.

1275
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,621
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

1276
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,563
"Of all things"

1277
01:44:30,631 --> 01:44:33,293
"my dad died
of a neglected cold."

1278
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:47,604
"It was the New Year Day
when I was in the 3rd year."

1279
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,747
"Because of the funeral"

1280
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:53,650
"right after New Year,
it was hectic."

1281
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:56,189
Ouch.

1282
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:57,553
Akane, it hurts.

1283
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,922
"Mom collapsed from fatigue."

1284
01:45:03,997 --> 01:45:06,465
"The new term had started"

1285
01:45:06,533 --> 01:45:10,128
"but I couldn't go to school."

1286
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,170
"One day..."

1287
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:21,912
Yes?

1288
01:45:26,953 --> 01:45:27,749
What?

1289
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:29,282
What's up?

1290
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:31,920
Why are you here?

1291
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:33,691
- -What happened to school?
- -What happened to school?

1292
01:45:37,464 --> 01:45:38,488
What is it?

1293
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:40,996
Just this.

1294
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,660
Borrowed it before the break.

1295
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:46,296
Forgot to return it.

1296
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:47,632
Return it.

1297
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:50,305
Why don't you
return yourself?

1298
01:45:50,744 --> 01:45:51,802
I'm asking you

1299
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,072
because I can't.

1300
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:54,211
Why not?

1301
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:56,772
Please return it.

1302
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:01,788
IN MOURNING

1303
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,290
Did anyone die?

1304
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:07,382
My dad did.

1305
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:15,961
Please accept
my sympathy for your loss.

1306
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,698
What's wrong?

1307
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:23,136
Nothing.

1308
01:46:44,431 --> 01:46:46,899
"That was
the last time I saw him."

1309
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:52,162
"When I went to school
a week later..."

1310
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:06,250
It's Inaba's doing again.

1311
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,953
No, I didn't do it. He did it.

1312
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:14,087
Did you know Fujii
transferred to another school?

1313
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,593
Seems it was so sudden
he couldn't say goodbye.

1314
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:23,100
What is it?

1315
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:38,943
Itsuki.

1316
01:48:12,853 --> 01:48:14,616
FUJll ITSUKI

1317
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:20,451
REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS LOST

1318
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:54,192
"This is the last memory
I have of him."

1319
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:57,625
"And this is probably
the last story"

1320
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,722
"I can write to you about."

1321
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:03,525
Itsuki.

1322
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:05,168
Wait a second.

1323
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:06,637
Almost done.

1324
01:49:10,577 --> 01:49:12,977
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

1325
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:17,611
"The memories written
in these letters belong to you."

1326
01:49:17,684 --> 01:49:20,619
"So you should hang on to them."

1327
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:24,857
"Thank you for all your kindness."

1328
01:49:25,158 --> 01:49:27,956
"I truly appreciate it."

1329
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:30,554
"P. S..."

1330
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:34,666
"P. S... The name
on the library cards"

1331
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:37,828
"was it really his name?"

1332
01:49:38,004 --> 01:49:40,336
What does she mean?

1333
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:42,902
"I have a feeling"

1334
01:49:42,976 --> 01:49:46,673
"the name he wrote
was intended to be your name."

1335
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:51,715
What? What does she
mean by this?

1336
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:53,516
What is it?

1337
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:55,115
Nothing.

1338
01:49:58,224 --> 01:50:01,591
I had a classmate in
junior high with the same name.

1339
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:03,185
And it was a boy.

1340
01:50:03,863 --> 01:50:04,795
And?

1341
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:06,357
That's all.

1342
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,364
Was he your first love?

1343
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,195
Wasn't anything like that.

1344
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:13,501
There was such a boy. That's all.

1345
01:50:16,509 --> 01:50:18,636
When I planted that tree

1346
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,843
I gave it a name.

1347
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,517
Can you guess what name it is?

1348
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:27,216
No.

1349
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:29,154
I named it <i>Itsuki</i>.

1350
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,853
The same as your name.

1351
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,727
You're kidding.

1352
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,455
When you were born

1353
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:41,363
I planted that tree.

1354
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:46,565
That's why I gave
both of you the same name.

1355
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:47,900
Which one?

1356
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:49,566
You didn't know, huh?

1357
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:51,568
Which tree is it?

1358
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:54,971
That one?

1359
01:50:57,217 --> 01:50:58,206
That?

1360
01:50:58,985 --> 01:51:00,475
What are you two up to?

1361
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:03,489
Is it really true?

1362
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,455
Didn't you make it up?

1363
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:16,297
This is it.

1364
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:23,931
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko,
my strange pen-pal"

1365
01:51:24,044 --> 01:51:25,409
"How are you doing?"

1366
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:27,870
"I'm doing well as usual."

1367
01:51:27,947 --> 01:51:30,142
"As for <i>how usual</i>, I am..."

1368
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,309
"Never mind that."

1369
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:36,520
"Something great happened today."

1370
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,054
"I want to tell you about it."

1371
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:41,093
"That's why I'm writing this."

1372
01:51:41,194 --> 01:51:43,822
Or rather, banging my keyboard.

1373
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:49,324
"It was brought on
by unexpected visitors."

1374
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,061
Hurry up. Hurry.

1375
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:03,683
Oh, hi.

1376
01:52:03,683 --> 01:52:05,048
Hello.

1377
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:07,547
What's going on?

1378
01:52:07,787 --> 01:52:10,881
We found something very nice.

1379
01:52:13,526 --> 01:52:14,288
It's this.

1380
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:24,335
The back cover.

1381
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:25,428
It's inside.

1382
01:52:25,505 --> 01:52:26,199
Other side.

1383
01:52:26,272 --> 01:52:27,864
The card in the back.

1384
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:42,617
The back.

1385
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:43,347
The back.

1386
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:19,115
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

1387
01:53:21,895 --> 01:53:23,988
"I'm too embarrassed"

1388
01:53:24,497 --> 01:53:26,761
"to mail this letter to you."
