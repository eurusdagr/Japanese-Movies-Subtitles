1
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:58,442
This film is based on a mysterious incident
my ex-girlfriend experienced.

2
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,960
Everything seems to be a lie.

3
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,478
Things here,

4
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,541
this place,

5
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,789
I myself,

6
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:11,164
and you.

7
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:16,672
Everything looks fake.

8
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:33,183
Somewhere in my head
I feel everything exists here.

9
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,454
But then again.

10
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:47,698
There's another part of me
wondering if it's real at all.

11
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,015
It used to be different.

12
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,925
How can I say...?

13
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,963
The sun looked like the sun.

14
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,411
How can I describe...?

15
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,719
The rhythm of nature...?

16
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,831
Something like that.

17
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:51,096
I thought my life was based on it.

18
00:10:55,706 --> 00:11:07,140
But I don't know
when I started doubting.

19
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:13,451
I became numb.

20
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:22,527
I started wondering

21
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:32,705
whether it was there to begin with.

22
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,875
So...

23
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,960
I can't concentrate.

24
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,138
I can't create.

25
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,669
I can't write.

26
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,188
I feel like I lost something vital
in my heart.

27
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:36,367
Well... why don't you find a job?

28
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:44,305
Forget about scriptwriting for now.

29
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:56,052
When you're active,
you won't go weird in your head.

30
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:59,597
I believe so.

31
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:08,972
I wish I could work
on films, too.

32
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:13,344
But even if we don't want,

33
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:19,681
we have to earn for our living.
Otherwise our life is finished.

34
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,587
That's not true.

35
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:31,328
This is more important
than eating and drinking.

36
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:37,930
I know what you mean.

37
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:43,096
But we can't go on like this.

38
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,706
Right?

39
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,314
Everything is just reasonable.

40
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:56,916
What?

41
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:33,488
You actually know it,
don't you?

42
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:55,677
You can't work
on your new film

43
00:14:55,677 --> 00:15:01,775
when you lost the vital thing
in your heart.

44
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:08,117
Right?

45
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:42,281
Cut!

46
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,988
Well...

47
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:28,622
I see you've got a problem,

48
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,867
but I can't see what it is.

49
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:54,349
This is not
what I want to express.

50
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:08,133
It doesn't convey what I want.

51
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:24,743
But you wrote those lines.

52
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,449
This is your script.

53
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,723
Now I understood,

54
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:44,569
after I played it by myself.

55
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,679
Can we start over?

56
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:08,630
If it was up to me,
oh, yes, we could,

57
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,428
but this is no longer
between you and me only.

58
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:18,340
We've already involved the crew.

59
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:25,472
What are we going to do with the 8 million
yen
we've already spent for this film?

60
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,449
Get into debt again?

61
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:32,911
That's impossible.

62
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:45,961
You've done something
like this before.

63
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:53,104
You've already got
another case like this.

64
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,080
What will happen if you quit
this project in the middle,

65
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,015
and cause another trouble?

66
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,573
It's fatal.

67
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:10,820
You'll never find an investor
for your project.

68
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:26,001
This project was already tough to
finance with what you did in the past.

69
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,548
It's a small world.
Everyone knows what you've done.

70
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:41,148
You seriously want to continue
making films, right?

71
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:58,261
We came all the way for this film.
Why don't we finish this one as it is?

72
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,467
Then you can start a new project
with your new ideas.

73
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,964
I think you should finish this film.

74
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,395
Am I wrong?

75
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,098
Am I wrong?

76
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:26,539
Stop being amateurish.

77
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,276
I can't stand it anymore.

78
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:43,282
It's already collapsing, isn't it?

79
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,727
Isn't it?

80
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,266
Isn't it?

81
00:20:57,574 --> 00:21:01,135
I can't protect you anymore.

82
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,406
Don't you understand?

83
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,012
I need a donut!

84
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,549
Get me a donut!

85
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:26,820
We have to cancel
today's shooting.

86
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:53,539
Ah, that's right...

87
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,721
Yeah, that's right...

88
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:31,173
Are you sleeping?

89
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:36,549
You must be exhausted.
Please take a good rest.

90
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:39,482
I'm sorry for this afternoon.

91
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:44,358
I was a bit tough on you.
But I believe in you.

92
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,452
Let's try our best
from tomorrow.

93
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:50,223
Don't worry.

94
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:53,768
Our film is already great
as it is.

95
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:55,326
Believe me.

96
00:26:56,471 --> 00:27:00,675
I don't want
to disturb your sleep.

97
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,700
I won't drop by today.

98
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:05,177
Good night.

99
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,041
Please call me
if you need anything.

100
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,510
I'm so stupid.

101
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,225
Why am I keep crying?

102
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:57,592
No! No! No!
This is not the time.

103
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:16,620
I told you,
I don't feel alive.

104
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:57,600
Do you understand...?

105
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:03,578
Do you feel alive?

106
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,919
I don't.

107
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:08,578
I don't.

108
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:13,381
I can't.

109
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,887
What is the rhythm
of nature?

110
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:27,634
I don't feel it anymore.

111
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:33,539
I don't want to say stuff
like this anymore.

112
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,759
Time is running out.

113
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,141
I can't breathe.

114
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,297
I wish everybody would die.

115
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:43,505
I'm a little tired.

116
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:59,221
I think I need a break for
about a month or so.

117
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:06,421
I'm tired

118
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:12,821
In both spiritual and physical way I'm tired

119
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:16,921
I think I have to take my time 
and go through the points once again

120
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,355
Please don't look for me.

121
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:35,433
We are born to be happy,

122
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,062
not to be unhappy.

123
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:49,637
This moment, this state,
this is the ultimate happiness.

124
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,951
I was born to achieve this,

125
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:05,455
therefore I can stay like this.

126
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:13,833
I wasn't wrong, isn't it?

127
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Get yourself together (flipped and written backwards)

128
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:18,595
I knew you'd be here.

129
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:26,263
Are you also alone?

130
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:28,664
Yes.

131
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,312
Don't you feel lonely?

132
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,611
No.

133
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:52,056
It's great we came all the way.

134
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:54,329
Yes.

135
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:06,922
I feel my true self here.

136
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:11,204
I don't think I can go
back to Tokyo.

137
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:12,330
Really...

138
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:36,155
Wherever you are,
you are no one but you.

139
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:43,836
Whether you are here
or there,

140
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:48,102
everything is just
the mirror of your mind.

141
00:46:57,183 --> 00:47:00,319
You've already begun
to understand

142
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,956
You've already begun
to understand

143
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:09,223
that everything is just
reflecting your mind.

144
00:47:16,702 --> 00:47:24,700
You are always creating
the world you see.

145
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,756
I have to go now.

146
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:53,839
Can I see you tomorrow?

147
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,907
I decided to stay here.

148
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:00,979
Really?

149
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:14,585
You've got someone waiting
for you over there.

150
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:21,690
You've got things
to do overthere.

151
00:48:26,939 --> 00:48:38,783
Wherever you are,
this place is always with you.

152
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:14,450
You'll be all right

153
00:49:40,963 --> 00:49:43,488
You'll be all right

154
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:23,275
Can you see?

155
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:26,069
Please nod
if you can see this.

156
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:30,850
Don't worry,
you'll be all right.

157
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,148
Please wait for a while.

158
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:41,153
Try it again.

159
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:47,529
Set it to 200.

160
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:53,562
Watch out.

161
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:57,703
1, 2, 3.

162
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:03,575
Set it to max.

163
00:51:04,914 --> 00:51:06,142
Max. Power.

164
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:09,848
Watch out.

165
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:14,516
1, 2, 3.

166
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:00,243
10:22 a.m.

167
00:52:55,669 --> 00:52:59,105
Are you sure
you don't know her?

168
00:53:01,475 --> 00:53:04,672
This is very important,
please tell us if you do.

169
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:16,390
Still nothing identifying her?

170
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,482
No...

171
00:53:17,482 --> 00:53:18,982
We cannot find any relatives

172
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:22,113
Poor girl, but for us
it's another trouble...

173
00:53:31,663 --> 00:53:34,097
Strange things happen.

174
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,703
It was a shock.

175
00:53:37,703 --> 00:53:40,763
Two girls at once,
from different places in the same state.

176
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,242
I thought it's that stuff
on the media,

177
00:53:44,242 --> 00:53:46,545
you know, strangers get together
through websites

178
00:53:46,545 --> 00:53:49,036
and kill themselves together.

179
00:53:52,284 --> 00:53:55,720
Sorry, you're not ready
to talk about this...

180
00:53:57,122 --> 00:54:01,560
What separates the one coming back
from the one going?

181
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,255
Very mysterious...

182
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:07,327
How are you feeling?

183
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,738
Everybody is worried
and waiting in the hallway.

184
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:14,262
Shall I call them inside?

185
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,303
Do you want to see
anyone particular?

186
00:54:24,401 --> 00:54:26,631
Shall we wait till
she settles down?

187
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:41,346
Please push this button
to call us. Okay?

188
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,886
We'll come check you later.

189
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:38,666
After this incident,

190
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:44,772
she started a new life
by breaking up with me,

191
00:55:44,772 --> 00:55:50,210
her partner both
in private and work.

192
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:56,184
I heard she is working hard like
a different person supporting herself,

193
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,210
and planning her new film.

194
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:12,681
To be honest,

195
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:17,311
I think she made up most of this story
this impressive near-death experience

196
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:26,550
by her imagination
to change herself.

197
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:33,201
I feel it's too perfect
to be true.

198
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:39,367
What happened is exactly like the image
she had in her mind.

199
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:38,026
Anyway, after all, it doesn't matter
whether it was true or not.

200
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:47,993
I just sincerely hope
that she will be fine from now on.
