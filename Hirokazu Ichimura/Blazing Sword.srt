00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,450


15
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,280
It was May of the 4th
year of Ansei, in Hinojuku.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,719
A hot and humid night in early summer.

17
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,250
It happened on the festival night
at Rokusho Meijin in Fuchu...

18
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,460
Toshi, where are you going?

19
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,500
Are you heading for Myojin
to look for women?

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,969
It’s too early for that!

21
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:45,170
Why not come to my place? I’ll
keep the door open for you!

22
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,180
Idiot!

23
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,740
Don't you know Toshi
doesn’t go for farm girls?

24
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,479
His women have to have class!

25
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,409
Toshi, is that true?

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,689
Hurry up and run!

27
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,189
Don't forget where we promised to meet!

28
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,209
We swore that if we die, we'll die
together! I'll never leave you behind!

29
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,519
Stop that woman!

30
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,939
Doesn't look like much of a fight...

31
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,210
Are they serious?

32
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,159
Somebody help us! He's going to be killed!

33
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,400
Toshi, help them! Please!

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,069
Not me!

35
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,259
I like fighting, but I won't
interrupt a revenge match.

36
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,710
Damn you!

37
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,469
If you're going to kill
me, go ahead kill me!

38
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:55,879
kill me!
- We're not through with you yet!

39
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,650
You'd better come back and get to work!

40
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,379
No!

41
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,479
If I have to go back there, I'd rather die!

42
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,080
kill me! kill me!

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,849
Let go of me! Let go!

44
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,460
Release that woman!

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,629
Mind your own business,
or we'll cut you down!

46
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,039
Stop it! Toshi!

47
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,030
Don't! Toshi, stop!

48
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,639
Sister, what are you doing here?

49
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,069
What's the matter with you?
Why are you using your sword?

50
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,250
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

51
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,949
No, I didn't! I just tried to scare them.

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,889
My sweetheart...

53
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,170
My beloved!

54
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,600
Toshi, go back to the house.
There was a break-in at the Dojo!

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,939
A break-in?

56
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,509
Hiruma of Kogen Ittoryu in Hachioji...

57
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,040
He knew Isami wasn't
there, so he broke in...

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,350
Toshi, wait for me!

59
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,689
Don't forget the Sennin Toshi
men of Hachioji are behind him!

60
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,720
I know.

61
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,730
The man swinging the bamboo
stick is Rokusha Sohaku.

62
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,100
The one with a birth mark under
his eye's Shichiri Kennosuke.

63
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,899
Shichiri Kennosuke can
draw a sword in a flash...

64
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,079
like his right arm's longer than his left...

65
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,410
I don't like him.

66
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,620
Are you saying you refuse
to accept my challenge?

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,110
All right!

68
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,560
If you don't accept my challenge...

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,120
the Tennen Rishin style must
bow to the Kogen Itto style.

70
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:34,159
You must apologize and
treat our dojo with respect...

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Hiruma...

72
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,579
Our students are just amateurs,
working as farmers...

73
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,850
We don't have the skill to
fight the Kogen Itto style...

74
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,180
Silence!

75
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,509
Swordsmanship is in our souls!
You must have confidence!

76
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,759
We can't let you use it as a game for
lowly farm-boys! Do you understand me?

77
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,959
Do they?

78
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,829
They may be low-class farmers,
but they own 3 tanbu each...

79
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,829
and belong to the Matsue Shogun family,
reinforcements to the Shogun's army.

80
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,040
Since Kurofune arrived, the
Samurai are afraid to fight...

81
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,449
and can't do their part, so we
can't trust them with the Shogun.

82
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,990
So, we must practice our swords.

83
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,540
What's wrong with that?

84
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:27,589
Toshi!

85
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,319
Hey, Toshi!

86
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,879
Who is this?

87
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:36,930
He runs the Dojo and he's
my step-brother...Toshizo.

88
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,060
If you're the leader of the Dojo,
why not accept my challenge?

89
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,840
Yes, I should, but it's a waste of my time.

90
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
What did you say?

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,480
Your Kogen Itto style and our
Tennen Rishin style are so different...

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,649
It's a waste of time fighting.

93
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,639
If we don't try, how will you know?

94
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,860
Okay, let's fight!

95
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,480
Toshi, don't!

96
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,160
You'll lose.

97
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,459
I'll demonstrate our fighting
technique with a bamboo sword.

98
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,329
Stick to them, otherwise they won't leave.

99
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,560
I don't have a choice...

100
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,699
Hiruma...

101
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,569
Let me explain the Tennen Rishin style.

102
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,579
I'm a teacher of Tennen Rishin...

103
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:30,379
And I'm here to teach farmers
who want to join our dojo.

104
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,519
That's all.

105
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,319
It's none of your concern.

106
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:41,060
Not only that, we stay within the
Hinojuku area and never go to Hachioji.

107
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,459
Shut up!

108
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:50,699
The Saitama area is Kogen
Itto's territory, including Hino.

109
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,870
Rokusha!

110
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,439
I am Rokusha Sohaku, a teacher.

111
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,970
I am Hijikata Toshizo.

112
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:47,960
My point!

113
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,289
The match!

114
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,720
Not yet!

115
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,269
What do you mean?

116
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,169
You're not just ignorant of
technique, you're defying the judge!

117
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,210
That's why I said we won't
accept your challenge.

118
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,340
What?

119
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,830
In our style, first we
retreat, and we retreat...

120
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,879
Finally we attack...

121
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,019
You're lucky we,re using bamboo swords.

122
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,710
If we were really fighting...

123
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:13,879
Your face would already be bleeding and
then, you'd be attacked from behind.

124
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,419
Look.

125
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,789
Your tobacco case!

126
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:19,230
It can't be...

127
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,929
In a real fight, your hand
would be cut in two!

128
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,429
I can hold a sword in my other hand.

129
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,269
If we were fighting to the death,
the match would be mine!

130
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,629
Will you shut up!

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,840
You've lost! You're still
refusing to admit defeat.

132
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,860
Regardless of your
opinion, I won the match.

133
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,840
I don't care what you say about it!

134
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,870
Am I right, Isami?

135
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,240
Isami, you'd better not say that I lost.

136
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,169
You lost, Toshi.

137
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,009
You're the loser of the
bamboo sword match.

138
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,450
Nobody will give you
extra points for brains...

139
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,190
If you're going to teach a fencing
style, can't you teach it correctly?

140
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,039
Wait!

141
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,429
Toshi, you're persistent!

142
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,509
What are you doing?

143
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,409
What can I prove with this!

144
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,539
They only saw me fight with bamboo!
They can't see my skills with steel!

145
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,519
I'll ask you, how would I have
done if this fight was real?

146
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,590
I've told you, we won't know
until you do fight for real.

147
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,730
All right!

148
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,330
From now on, I'm going
to fight only with steel.

149
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,929
Only true matches so that
anyone can tell the difference.

150
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,230
Maybe it's a good idea...

151
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,539
Who cares about the Kogen Itto style?
Who cares about being a samurai?

152
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,840
This is the day of the warrior.

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,740
If we want to conquer the
world, we'll do that too.

154
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,110
Isami, I promise you I'm going
to turn you into a Daimyo!

155
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,409
Toshi, your head's getting
too big again, isn't it?

156
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,250
I'm serious.

157
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,379
I understand.

158
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,179
We must reach the top of the
world with our swords alone.

159
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,580
That's our only chance of success.

160
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,159
Kondo, let's do it!

161
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,399
Then please, help me do it.

162
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,960
Okay, leave it to me.

163
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,470
Toshi's technique is unearthly...

164
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,110
He must be possessed by ghosts.

165
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,470
Yeah, right! By a crazy female ghost!

166
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,190
Toshi, come over here for a minute!

167
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,549
What is it, sister?

168
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,549
What's this, Toshi?

169
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,929
Where did you find that?

170
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:22,830
In your room. Why are they in your room?

171
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,919
I don't know.

172
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,529
Found them on the street...

173
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:26,730
You fool!

174
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:35,230
This mark on the bag is the proof
mark of Lord Sawatari of Sado.

175
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,470
Sawatari?

176
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,480
It must be Sae's, she's
the sister of Sawatari...

177
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,649
I think you saw Sae at last
night's fair, didn't you?

178
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,980
I guess...

179
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,629
Toshi, you'd better get married soon.

180
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,070
I can find a wife for you.

181
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,759
Stop! I have so many things to do.

182
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,700
A man with a wife and
children can't do anything.

183
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,750
She's Sawatari's sister...

184
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,679
Toshi, Sae is not for you!
Think of who you are!

185
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,679
Think about who I am?

186
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,279
Who's there?

187
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,769
The man you met last night.

188
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,919
I came to give this back to you.

189
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,889
You don't have to thank me,
but I want to ask one thing.

190
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,059
You're a woman born to a great family...

191
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,929
Why did you act like a farm girl last night?

192
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,840
The 'Night Fair, is for farmers
who worked all year...

193
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,539
to relax and enjoy themselves
like human beings for a night.

194
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,419
It's not for an upper
class woman like you.

195
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,610
I just wanted to forget my status...

196
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,610
for one night.

197
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,129
So, you've had too much red snapper
and wanted to try a sardine last night.

198
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:38,860
And that sardine was me.

199
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,000
Please leave!

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,269
No, I won't.

201
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,570
I'm sure you realize I'm not here...

202
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,740
just to return the bag after
what passed between us...

203
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,049
I'm trying to forget last night.

204
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,879
That was a gift for my God from me.

205
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,660
Please forget last night!

206
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,559
I won't forget! That's why I'm here.

207
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,970
There's a legend that if a man and
woman sleep together during the Fair...

208
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,839
God will punish them and they'll
belong to each other forever.

209
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,670
According to the legend, I belong to you.

210
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,400
It's true!

211
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,500
If you don't want me,
kindly kill me with this!

212
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,079
You say you want to forget
who you are for one night...

213
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:32,809
But if you hate your position,
why don't you leave?

214
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,519
If I could do that, I'd do it
now. You don't understand.

215
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,720
No, I don't!

216
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,490
But I'm going to make
you do it right now.

217
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,839
Oh, it's you!

218
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,539
It's me. What about it?

219
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:42,490
Since I'm a Sawatari
family guard, I'll kill you!

220
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,430
Since when does a Kogen Itto
man get demoted to a guard?

221
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,859
The other day you said
you'd have won a real fight.

222
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,869
Have you ever killed a man?

223
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,089
No, I haven't.

224
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,690
But today I'll kill my first man.

225
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,839
If two men with the same
skill at bamboo swords fight...

226
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:04,400
the man who's killed before will win.

227
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:09,640
A man's skill is different
before and after he has killed.

228
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,349
Do you understand?

229
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:12,750
Perhaps...

230
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:17,420
I'll find out very soon.

231
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,759
I killed him!

232
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,619
At last I've killed a man...

233
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:13,130
Finally... I've killed!

234
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,519
Damn it!

235
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,970
He fought many duels.

236
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,970
But who did this to Rokusha?

237
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,130
Was it revenge or a challenge?

238
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,819
Why didn't I kill him with my first swing?

239
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,450
Why couldn't I take one step
forward and slay him immediately?

240
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:12,529
Toshizo!

241
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,900
You killed Rokusho, didn't you?

242
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,470
How do you know my name?

243
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,680
Please do this for me!

244
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,210
Run away with me!

245
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,950
Run away? Why? Who
are we running from?

246
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,279
From our status!

247
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,859
You said you would make me leave.

248
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:51,460
If I stay, I'll never see you again.

249
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,299
You know of the bonds between the
Sawatari and Kujo families, don't you?

250
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:01,339
You mean the Kujo family
from Kuge in Kyoto?

251
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,049
To secure my brother's future, I
must marry into the Kujo family...

252
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,349
If you don't want to, why not refuse?

253
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:16,259
If people find out that
you killed Rokusha...

254
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,259
Are you saying I'm not
good enough for you?

255
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,730
If you love me, run away
with me right now!

256
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:30,500
It's true!

257
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,279
I love you from the bottom of my heart...

258
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,220
but a woman's love and
a man's are different.

259
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,450
A man doesn't love staying
together like a woman wishes.

260
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,660
A man must fight for his
life and defeat his enemies.

261
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:54,519
Win over himself and kill
whoever tries to stop him.

262
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,700
But you are my life!

263
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,039
What am I to you?

264
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,009
A prize in your fight? Am I your enemy?

265
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,779
Or...

266
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,210
Or what?

267
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,390
As you say, perhaps you are my enemy...

268
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,829
KOISHIKAWA, YANAGIMACHI

269
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,069
Oh, Soji!

270
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,140
I'm back!

271
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,470
Well, come in.

272
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,109
Hijikata, I went to Hino yesterday
and practiced at our Dojo.

273
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:13,569
Your brother and sister seemed very well.

274
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,950
Is that so?

275
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,480
They send their regards
and ask you to be careful.

276
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,819
Careful about what?

277
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,019
I don't know.

278
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,650
Sensei, Rokusha Sohaku was killed!

279
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,920
Did you say Rokusha
got killed? By whom?

280
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,660
The people at Hiruma Dojo are
looking hard for a suspect...

281
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,269
but they can't find one.

282
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,099
Hijikata, aren't you going to practice?

283
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,640
Strange for you to take a nap
in the middle of a day, isn't it?

284
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,509
Something wrong with you?

285
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,670
Shut up! A kid doesn't understand!

286
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,279
What could have happened to him?

287
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,119
I don't know.

288
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,920
I don't know what happened,
but he's a changed man.

289
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,619
Lately no one wants to
be his practice partner.

290
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,130
I'm having a hard time getting
them to practice with him.

291
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:12,440
Sensei, there's a man
called Shichiri Kennosuke...

292
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,309
a member of Hiruma Dojo, here
to request a practice match.

293
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,329
What? Shichiri's here?

294
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:21,150
Isami, let me ask you...

295
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,819
Is there a technique to block...

296
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,680
an enemy's first sword swing
in the Tennen Rishin style?

297
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,710
At first, step back...

298
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,990
Second, step back and
back, step back...that's it!

299
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,220
If there's no room to step
back, what should I do?

300
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,890
Take a breath and slice their sword
guard with the end of your blade.

301
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,500
If it's too late for that, what should I do?

302
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,789
You're going to be killed.

303
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,829
Anyway, Shichiri wants me
for a partner, so I'd better go!

304
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,029
No, you're not!

305
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm the owner of this Dojo.
Mind your own business!

306
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,710
But he wants me to...

307
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,470
This is the middle of Edo.

308
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,440
It's not a little country town.

309
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,319
Thank you for accepting my request.

310
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,309
Our dojo rules for a practice
match are three to a game.

311
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,660
Hey, Todorisuke, you're the first!

312
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:17,369
I'm sure you remember Rokusha
Sohaku who came for a challenge fight.

313
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,740
He's dead.

314
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,309
I see...

315
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,599
Because he had a few sword wounds...

316
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:28,450
the law thinks there were a few attackers.

317
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,039
A few attackers?

318
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,480
Fools.

319
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,630
Fight's over!

320
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,799
Next! Nagakura Shinpachi!

321
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,250
Fight's over!

322
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,759
Next! Inoue Genzaburo!

323
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,730
One moment!

324
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:24,799
One group against another should
fight with a different style...

325
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,779
and I now understand this Dojo's style.

326
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,170
I see...

327
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,170
Will you quit now?

328
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,509
Never! I will never quit.

329
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,589
I'd never do such a rude thing.

330
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:45,079
But I hear your Dojo has a special
technique called the Sunegiri Art...

331
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,089
that attacks knees and thighs.

332
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,960
The art you're probably
thinking of is the Ryubo style...

333
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,940
our Tennen Rishin style
has no such technique.

334
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:05,109
But, there are people who can
use many styles and techniques.

335
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,410
The man who killed
Rokusha is one of them.

336
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,880
I can tell by looking at his wounds...

337
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
It's an evil and cowardly art!

338
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,460
I'm going to find out who
this man is and kill him!

339
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,390
Hijikata, don't let him provoke you!

340
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,450
Shut up!

341
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,690
I'm going to be next!

342
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,279
Wait!

343
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,109
Do you like my Nejiri Art?

344
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,410
It was you!

345
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,150
Surely, this style was
used to kill Rokusha.

346
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,980
No! This style didn't kill hm!

347
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:50,720
It doesn't matter, thigh or
elsewhere, my sword will slice all!

348
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,119
It was the spirit of the Tennen
Rishin style that gave me victory.

349
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,619
What's going on?

350
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,829
Are you villains teaming up to rob us?

351
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,670
This is a challenge with Samurai pride!

352
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,299
Pardon...

353
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,650
but it's not proper to fight in the
Shogun's family Dojo. If you do...

354
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,740
you'll be blamed for starting a quarrel.

355
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,210
Isn't that right?

356
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,190
Fine.

357
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,859
I'll come back and look at
Hijikata Toshizo's style again.

358
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,160
Your Sunegiri Style, a farmer's
art and it's only good at night.

359
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,099
Toshi!
- Hijikata!

360
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,670
Hijikata!

361
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,710
Hijikata!

362
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,210
It's you! What do you want?

363
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,720
What do I want? How can you say that?

364
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,650
I got up in the middle of
the night to look for you.

365
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,250
But you were gone.

366
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,119
I thought you went to the Dojo by
yourself, so I woke Master Kondo.

367
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,759
He said, ''I can't let dear Toshizo be killed.

368
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,730
''Please Okita, go after him
and help...'' Just like that.

369
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,000
How can I let a kid help me!
Mind your own business!

370
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,660
Go home and go back to bed!

371
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,640
Hijikata, are you really going to do it?

372
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,869
Fool!

373
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,549
How can we say and do nothing...

374
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,579
after they show up at our
Dojo and insulted us like that?

375
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,740
Think about it!

376
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,720
You're right! I'll go with you!

377
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,789
You'd better not! It's
nothing to do with you.

378
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:35,299
If we let you die, the Tennen
Rishin style's name will fade away.

379
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,589
You can't!

380
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,769
You've never killed a man.

381
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:40,200
That's why I must go!

382
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,890
Toshi, you must leave as
soon as you finish eating...

383
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,359
or the men of the Hiruma
Dojo will find you.

384
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,690
I saw them not long ago.

385
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,829
Toshi!

386
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,460
They're coming soon.

387
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,759
Coming here?

388
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,559
Don't worry!

389
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,289
They'll just bring a letter to
request a challenge match.

390
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,450
Are you Okita Soji of the Kondo Dojo?

391
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,990
You know very well.

392
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,359
Please give my message
to Hijikata Toshizo!

393
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,329
Tell him we know who killed Rokusha
and we could go to the police...

394
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:43,930
but we of Hiruma Dojo take pity on
you and we won't, he needn't worry.

395
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,059
And?

396
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:51,000
Too bad I discovered his pian to
sneak in and attack me in the night...

397
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,769
No matter how good he is with
technique, he won't succeed tonight!

398
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,579
Where? What time?

399
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:04,680
The place is the bridge
over Buai river at midnight.

400
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,519
Just the two of you.

401
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,470
Don't fight!

402
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,160
It's not a fight.

403
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,710
Just a wild dog running
around here and bothering us.

404
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,069
I'm going to get rid of him.

405
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:29,740
I see, it's a wild dog.

406
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,140
Yes, a wild dog.

407
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:35,480
You've set a time and place, haven't you?

408
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,980
Yes, I've set a time and place.

409
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:44,119
Don't attack a wild dog head-on.

410
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,049
Attack it from the side.

411
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,920
Is that so?

412
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,430
By the way brother, I have a favor to ask.

413
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,799
What is it?

414
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,259
After I kill the dog, I'll
leave it under the bridge.

415
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,470
Please send some men to
get rid of the dead dog.

416
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,569
Right, no problem!

417
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,329
Good night.
- Later.

418
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,929
How was it?

419
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,260
It's a problem!

420
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,059
I'm not sure because of the darkness...

421
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,429
but I'd guess about twenty men
are hiding around the place.

422
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,590
Shichiri's a liar!

423
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,500
He told me only two men would show up.

424
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,809
How many on the bridge?

425
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,360
There's only two.

426
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,079
But there's 3 or 4 men
under the farmhouse roof...

427
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,550
and 3 or 4 more hiding
in the grass nearby.

428
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,219
Where are most of them hiding?

429
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,349
North of the bridge, behind
the hut and behind the oak.

430
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,150
They're all over the place.

431
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,019
I can imagine...

432
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,329
They're expecting us to come
south on the Kamakura highway.

433
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,599
That's the common route.

434
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,670
Hey, why are you staring at me?

435
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,159
No, I'm just admiring you.

436
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,940
And thinking that you're not
just a good man in a fight.

437
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,809
You idiot!

438
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:09,480
You shouldn't tease an adult!
Just keep your eyes on the map!

439
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,269
We'd better figure out what to do,
because there's only two of us...

440
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,050
How about this area?

441
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,949
I only saw one shadow moving.

442
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:17,969
Okay!

443
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,039
Thanks.

444
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:25,960
Soji, we're going to
attack by the river first.

445
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,460
You start from up-river.

446
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,949
I'll start from down-river and I'll
attack the men under the bridge.

447
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,269
This is a tough position.

448
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,840
We're stuck like a
snapping turtle in the mud.

449
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
That's our strategy!

450
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,710
I admire your style, but what style is this?

451
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,679
It's Hijikata style!

452
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,820
Can't be. It's snapping turtle style.

453
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,400
Now I'm going to sneak
in under the bridge.

454
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,000
You turn back and start from the south.

455
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,440
I have no choice!

456
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,250
Okita Soji, here I come!

457
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:15,360
Go after him!

458
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,559
Get him!

459
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,440
Go after him!

460
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,360
Let's get out of here!

461
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,829
Get them! Chase them!

462
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:06,570
Toshi!

463
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,699
Toshi!

464
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:21,289
Do you have any medicine?

465
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:28,599
Soji, did you get hurt?

466
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,469
How's the bite of the wild dog?

467
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:33,909
The Tennen Rishin style isn't that bad.

468
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,340
Now you've been in a fight and
learned true fighting technique.

469
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,400
Did you see them?

470
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,980
Over here!

471
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,719
What time is it?

472
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,119
It's 4.

473
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,119
You're leaving already?

474
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,050
Sorry for the trouble.

475
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,329
Toshi...

476
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm going to Kyoto tomorrow.

477
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,849
Hey, they're over here!

478
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,510
Go after them!

479
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:24,880
Sae...

480
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,449
I don't know who you're watching...

481
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,730
but you can't walk around
here anytime you wish.

482
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:35,829
I'm replacing Rokusha
and I'm your guard.

483
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,030
Thank you but no thanks!

484
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,199
I see...

485
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:47,139
Is it inconvenient for you
to have me hanging about?

486
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,889
No matter where you
hide Hijikata Toshizo...

487
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:59,980
I'll find him and I'll kill him!

488
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,809
FIvE YEARS LATER
THIRD YEAR OF BUNKYU (1863)

489
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:13,500
Five years later, in the
Third Year of Bunkyu.

490
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:18,110
The Tokugawa Government
sent about 234 ronin...

491
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,010
including Kiyokawa Hachiro
of Shonai, to Kyoto...

492
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:28,579
to stop the men who wanted
to destroy the Shogunate...

493
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:38,719
In the name of Tennen Rishin-ryu,
Kondo and Hijikata joined this group...

494
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,739
Kondo, why do you have such
a humble post in this group?

495
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,179
I don't know.

496
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,679
They don't respect the Tennen Rishin.

497
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,980
A man who drinks all day is
the leader in this group...

498
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
and even his follower
has a manager's role.

499
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,949
It's nonsense!

500
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,019
Serizawa Kamon.

501
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:11,949
He's a survivor of the Mito Tengu group.

502
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,130
We don't care who he is!

503
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,429
They chose us for our skills, didn't they?

504
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:23,030
You sound like Toshi now...

505
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:27,539
Hey Toshi...

506
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,079
You said you'd make me a
Daimyo someday, remember?

507
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,250
Of course I do!

508
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,550
Why did you say that?

509
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,159
Why not?

510
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,829
A man who has skill and
power should be a Daimyo...

511
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:41,690
If not, something's
wrong with the system.

512
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,820
Can you smell it?

513
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,000
I can smell it all right!

514
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,989
Won't be long before you're a Daimyo!

515
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,869
KYOTO

516
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,269
Everybody...

517
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,579
I, Kiyokawa, will give a
very important speech.

518
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,010
Please listen carefully and pay attention!

519
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:14,230
We're gathered to guard the
Shogun's family, visiting Kyoto.

520
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,750
Well, this is just a cover story.

521
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,070
Our true goal is the principle
of reverence for the Emperor...

522
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,469
and the expulsion of foreigners.

523
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,929
And to build a safe and peaceful country.

524
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:37,849
Kiyokawa Hachiro will kill anyone who
becomes an obstacle to my purpose...

525
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:42,880
even if he's a high ranking
officer of the Government!

526
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:48,920
Anybody disagree with me?

527
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,159
Yes!

528
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,900
Kiyokawa, you're using
underhanded methods!

529
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,420
Silence!

530
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,739
Serizawa, you're drunk again.

531
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:59,440
I'll listen to what you have
to say when you're sober.

532
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,070
Shut up! Shut up! You betrayer!

533
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:03,739
Kiyokawa...

534
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:08,309
We're here because
the Shogun invited us!

535
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,820
Until the Shogun orders
it, we can't leave Kyoto.

536
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,849
Who are you?

537
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,789
You're just a ronin!

538
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:22,949
You're not a man from any
Clan or the Government...

539
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,059
so your body and your
spirit should be free.

540
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,199
The country faces a
great storm these days...

541
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,409
so I must try hard to get permission to
take action in reverence for the Emperor!

542
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:39,869
If you're a man, stand up for yourself!

543
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,650
Believe in Kiyokawa and follow me!

544
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,630
I'm going to drink more Sake!

545
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,230
A woman! A woman!

546
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,130
Bring me a woman from Shimabara!

547
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:09,440
Toshi, what should we do?

548
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,579
I think this is an opportunity.

549
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:18,820
What?

550
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,280
The time has come for seven
men of the Tennen Rishin Style.

551
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:27,010
I was waiting for this chance!

552
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,329
Kiyokawa Hachiro is going
to make himself famous!

553
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:36,559
But what's going to happen to the
ronin who were chosen by Kiyokawa?

554
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,170
So, we replace Kiyokawa and
we build a new army of ronin.

555
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,340
I see...

556
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,840
Can we do it?

557
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,639
Yes, we can!

558
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,510
But there's one more man we can use.

559
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,610
Who's that?

560
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:53,380
That drunk, Serizawa Kamon.

561
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:56,920
I thought Hijikata didn't like drunks.

562
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I don't.

563
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,889
But he's connected with a member
of the Aizu Katamori clan...

564
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:04,449
of the Shogunate police in Kyoto and
he can help present our plans directly.

565
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,000
So we're going to use him.

566
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,130
That's an good idea!

567
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,730
Toshi, I agree with you.

568
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,969
Sannosuke, Harada, how about you?

569
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:15,369
It's up to Kondo.

570
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,380
Inoue Genzaburo agrees!

571
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,239
Nagakura Shinpachi will let you decide!

572
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,739
Todo Heisuke says go ahead!

573
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,019
Okita Soji agrees!

574
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,039
Good!

575
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:29,010
If everybody agrees, Isami...

576
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:33,960
We have to do something, to bring a
gift to the Kyoto Shogunate police.

577
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,289
Is it about Kiyokawa?

578
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,340
Working hard, Isami?

579
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,269
Has anyone seen Kiyokawa
leaving the Kujo clan's house?

580
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,320
I don't think so, how about you, Kondo?

581
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,389
No, I haven't seen anything.

582
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,429
How about we just break in to the place
Kiyokawa's staying in and attack him?

583
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,829
No, we must be patient.

584
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,739
Isami, please go and get some rest!

585
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:19,969
And Master Kondo too!

586
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,239
''Master Kondo''...?

587
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:26,780
If you put it that way, I'll do it.

588
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,539
It's getting cold and I'm
getting hungry too...

589
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,639
Eat something!

590
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,969
Kondo's still a country boy, if he trusts...

591
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:52,460
and relies on an unsociable man like you.

592
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:57,610
He's a good man.

593
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,769
He's our boss, our leader since childhood.

594
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,550
The house of Chief Advisor Kujo.

595
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,880
If I go to Kyoto, at least once I'd
like to sleep with a Kyoto woman.

596
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,559
Serizawa!

597
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:42,650
Wait! Let me handle this!

598
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,090
But...
- I'll do it!

599
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:48,659
I'm the new leader! I can't
let another do this job!

600
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,099
If they attack, you'll be left all alone!

601
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,130
If we waste time now, we
won't have time for Kiyokawa...

602
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,360
Damn it! Do what you want!

603
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:05,880
Here I go!
- Be careful!

604
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,000
I understand!

605
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,510
Toge!

606
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,039
Did he do it?

607
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,550
Damn it!

608
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,389
Who are you?

609
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,420
A man who appreciates your grudge!

610
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,429
Kiyokawa, we're here to summon you!

611
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:29,130
we'll take care of this!

612
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,570
Sir, now!

613
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,769
Kiyokawa, you're a coward!

614
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,440
It's no use chasing Kiyokawa! Let him go!

615
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,590
It's an assassination!

616
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:01,489
Toshi!

617
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,630
Come this way!

618
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:06,699
Sae!

619
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,900
Hurry!

620
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,099
Put out the light!

621
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,510
It's all right!

622
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,599
We're alone.

623
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,440
The only visitors here are
young girls, my students.

624
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,320
Is there something wrong?

625
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,360
You've changed...

626
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:13,369
Have I? Why did you say that?

627
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,539
You seem so honorable...

628
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,739
You look so good in your scarf...

629
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,000
You seem to belong here in Kyoto...

630
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,409
To survive in a dangerous world...

631
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:30,190
a woman needs somebody to lean on.

632
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:34,750
Is that why you joined the
anti-Shogunate rebels?

633
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:40,860
After 5 years, people can change.

634
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,500
Maybe you have a reason to look
forward in hope, but I don't.

635
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:50,210
Stop it! Give it all up!

636
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,610
Throw it away and go back to your home!

637
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,869
Please leave Kyoto!

638
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:59,440
Toshi, why say it now?

639
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:06,630
I begged you to run away
with me 5 years ago...

640
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,019
Don't say that!

641
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,300
If you don't go, I may
have to kill you some day.

642
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,659
I don't care!

643
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:23,769
I'd rather have you kill me than leave me.

644
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,570
I'm a woman...

645
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:36,380
I can't see tomorrow,
but now... now I want...

646
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:17,659
This may be the last
time we see each other.

647
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,400
Please take care of yourself.

648
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,360
Yes.

649
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:31,440
Kiyokawa Hachiro leaves today
for Kanto to raise an army.

650
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,869
An Imperial order will be
issued within three days.

651
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,619
Will you believe me?

652
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:43,780
Toshi, when we're together
I'm not your enemy...

653
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:46,289
I am only a woman.

654
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,659
Toshi...

655
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:19,320
Kiyokawa and his ronin stayed
in Kyoto for twenty days.

656
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,960
Ten men left behind, including Hijikata
Toshizo, tried to find employment.

657
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,900
They banded together and
called themselves Shinsengumi.

658
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,440
The people feared them...

659
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,099
and swore they were as wild
and dangerous as wolves.

660
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,800
Did you donate some money
yesterday? How much did you give?

661
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,070
For 3o years...

662
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:14,239
the world's been peaceful and rich.
You've had a good life, haven't you?

663
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,780
Please take this and leave.

664
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,280
We didn't come here for blackmail.

665
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:27,320
We just want to know if you
have gratitude in your heart!

666
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,889
KYOTO GOVERNMENT
POLICE HEAD QUARTERS

667
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,050
Sir...

668
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,900
Thanks to the Shinsengumi,
people don't fight every day...

669
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,429
and Kyoto can stay peaceful.

670
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:43,969
I will report to our Lord and thank you!

671
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:51,579
But, Serizawa is a problem...

672
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,719
The way he's managing things
affects all the Shinsengumi...

673
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,920
It's a shame. Because of him the
Shinsengumi may have to be dissolved.

674
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,559
Dissolved?

675
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,050
That's what the Lord said.

676
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,940
Someone was hit by a cannon shot...

677
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,769
in Yamateya Shobei's
home in Nishiyamaji...

678
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:15,360
and a woman was raped...

679
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:18,780
the mistress of Hishiya, a
prominent textile dealer.

680
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,010
I understand.

681
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,769
Kondo!

682
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:32,019
Yes, I can see his concerns.

683
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,070
Is he saying that "under these
circumstances, please accept it,,?

684
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:46,699
Toshi, you say you
understand, so I also said...

685
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:48,539
,'I understood...,,

686
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,730
but what was Tojima telling us?

687
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,949
He thinks we must kill Serizawa Kamon.

688
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,809
But Toshi...

689
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,849
Serizawa is the leader of the Shinsengumi.

690
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:03,559
He can't do whatever he
wants because he's the leader!

691
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:06,750
The leader can't dominate
the Shinsengumi.

692
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:10,590
I know. But you said...

693
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:17,690
We should use him because he had
connections in the Shogunate?

694
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,110
It doesn't matter, we must
kill whoever does wrong!

695
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,670
We're going to kill an evil man!

696
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,610
Whoever breaks our
rules, we must kill him!

697
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,699
And whoever disgraces the name of
the Shinsengumi, we must kill him!

698
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:32,349
If I did one of these things,
would you kill me, too?

699
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:35,110
Yes, I would!

700
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,360
Are you sure?

701
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,489
Yes, I am!

702
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,619
But on that day...

703
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,159
the life of Hijikata Toshizo will end...

704
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,059
and Okita will die...

705
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:58,070
and the Tennen Rishin style
and Shinsengumi will also die.

706
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,539
I understand, Toshi.

707
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,219
Kondo...

708
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,480
What is it?

709
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,809
You are the commander in chief!

710
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:11,889
You're not the owner of a
Dojo in some old dirty town...

711
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,780
and you're not a swordsman
feared by the people.

712
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,130
You're going to be a model for
samurai all over the world!

713
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,289
You're going to help lead
the people of the world!

714
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:29,170
Who needs the Daimyo? Who
needs leaders of the Shogun's clan?

715
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,329
Kondo...

716
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:36,409
You are the one who's a true
samurai! We are all true samurai!

717
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:42,980
SEPTEMBER, THIRD
YEAR OF BUNKYU (1863 )

718
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,159
Master Ninmi...

719
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,739
I hate to interrupt your
charming conversation.

720
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:07,849
Hijikata, you're a crude ruffian!

721
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:12,340
Ninmi, I came here to ask a favor of you.

722
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,150
I'd like you to commit Seppuku!

723
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,389
What?

724
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:19,619
I want you to commit Seppuku right here!

725
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,800
You're not in charge of the Shinsengumi!

726
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,730
I have no reason to take orders from you!

727
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,130
Yes, you have!

728
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,940
The crime was burglary,
and taking bribes.

729
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,900
You!

730
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,340
You want us to kill you?

731
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,210
I'm willing to let you commit
Seppuku like a noble samurai.

732
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,150
Master Ninmi!

733
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,630
This is the way to perform Seppuku!

734
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,599
Kondo!

735
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,670
Your friend Ninmi was ordered to commit
Seppuku because he broke our rules.

736
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,280
What?

737
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,769
Master Serizawa...

738
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,710
I'm very sorry but you must die as well.

739
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,909
Silence! My sword...

740
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:30,590
Master!

741
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,489
You bastard!

742
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:50,610
Isami, now you truly are
the leader of Shinsengumi!

743
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,510
And I am vice-leader, Hijikata Toshizo!

744
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,630
The rules of the Shin Sen Group:

745
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,960
1. Don't break the Group's rules.

746
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,199
2. Don't ever leave the Group.

747
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:12,739
3. Don't try to profit from the Group.

748
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,800
4. Don't get involved with the law.

749
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:20,800
5. Don't fight other
members of the Group.

750
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:27,409
Whoever breaks the rules, will
be ordered to perform Seppuku.

751
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:35,159
A man to target, a man to be targeted.

752
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:39,059
The victor today may be dead tomorrow.

753
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,699
Doubts about the assassinations grew in
the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

754
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,570
And there was a terrifying
atmosphere in the streets of Kyoto.

755
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,869
Katsura was a target, too...

756
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:52,610
They come to attack us, and
we in turn take revenge.

757
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,309
Back and forth. And it's so frightening.

758
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:57,079
I've heard a very ominous story.

759
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,949
They said that the ronin are
going to burn Kyoto down.

760
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,429
ONE YEAR LATER
SUMMER, FIRST YEAR OF GANJI (1864)

761
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:15,099
ONE YEAR LATER
SUMMER, FIRST YEAR OF GANJI (1864)
No! No! It's not true! It can't be true!

762
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,119
No! No! It's not true! It can't be true!

763
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:21,809
Of course, as you say, I
was called "Bragging Taro,,

764
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:26,639
...but now I'm just a handyman!

765
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,309
Silence. We have proof.

766
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:31,320
Everybody, it's the Shinsengumi!

767
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,840
Shut up!

768
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:35,090
All about the weapons and ammunition...

769
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,460
this letter from those ronin calling
themselves 'honorable samurai'...

770
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,159
You'd better come with us
and tell us if this is a fake!

771
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:43,389
If you're not guiity, we'll let you go home.

772
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:44,920
Come on!

773
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:50,059
TANTORA RESTURANT AND INN

774
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,730
Furutaka Shunsuke was arrested.

775
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,329
Sir!

776
01:02:56,469 --> 01:02:58,340
Sir what do we do?

777
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,250
We're going to try to break him out!

778
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,449
How?

779
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:03,780
We have to break in...

780
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,150
It's too reckless!

781
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,480
Reckless?

782
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,289
Furutaka's imprisoned
by the Shinsengumi.

783
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:12,849
But do we have any other choice?

784
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,389
You're right!

785
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,889
We were ready to die
when we came to Kyoto.

786
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,559
With that resolve, all things are possible!

787
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:22,230
But rushing to our death
is not the best way.

788
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,900
We'd simply be committing suicide!

789
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,969
Committing suicide? Watch your mouth!

790
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,800
What?

791
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:32,309
Wait a minute. We don't
have time to argue now.

792
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,570
Let's meet again tomorrow night...

793
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:44,880
to talk about setting the fire
and trying to rescue Furutaka!

794
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,559
We already know they
pian to set fires in Kyoto...

795
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,360
to breach the Imperial Palace.

796
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:57,000
They want to start a war and
destroy the Tokugawa Shogunate.

797
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,059
Their targets are Miyabi of
Higo, Yoshido of Goshu...

798
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,409
Kitazoe of Tosa and Momoyama.

799
01:04:02,409 --> 01:04:05,070
So far we have at least
twenty-two names.

800
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,679
Don't pretend you don't know...

801
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,480
we already know that they're
meeting at Tantora in Kiwamachi!

802
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,349
If you know, why ask me!

803
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:17,260
What else do you know? Maybe
their meeting date and time?

804
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,280
That's enough!

805
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,019
Furutaka...

806
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:29,099
You've kept your mouth shut this
long, your friends will forgive you.

807
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,099
Tell us everything.

808
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:33,730
I know nothing!

809
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:35,960
What can we do with you?

810
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:37,800
We're not going to stop until he speaks!

811
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:42,780
This is our moment in time...

812
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,139
when the Shin Sen Group becomes
the world-famous Shinsengumi!

813
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:03,900
Are you sure the place is Tantora?

814
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,369
On that snowy night... what time?

815
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,230
Toshi...

816
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:15,710
If we keep that up, he's going to die.

817
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:29,989
vice-leader!

818
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:31,059
What is it?

819
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:32,360
It's a letter!

820
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,659
To whom?

821
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,429
To Hijikata Toshizo.

822
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,659
From Sae.

823
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,300
Sae?

824
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,780
It's five years since you
saw her in Kyoto, isn't it?

825
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:04,690
Hijikata, she married into the Kujo clan.

826
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,230
She's connected with the
family of the Shogun.

827
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,719
I know that.

828
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,329
Hijikata!

829
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:17,480
I don't want to scold you but do
you understand the situation now?

830
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,039
That's why I'm going now!

831
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,239
This could be a trap!

832
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:21,909
And maybe it's not...

833
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,849
Even so, it's all right with me.

834
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,019
It's too dangerous to go
alone! I'm coming with you!

835
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:29,110
You idiot!

836
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:31,289
I'm going to see a woman!

837
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:36,960
Besides, if a scary-looking guy like you
comes along, even a ghost won't show.

838
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,340
Well, so long.

839
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,630
Pardon me.

840
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,260
Toshi!

841
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,599
As I expected, you've come to see me.

842
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,199
Please come in!

843
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,809
I've missed you!

844
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:36,949
Who did you send to bring me a letter?

845
01:07:37,789 --> 01:07:38,949
A letter?

846
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,340
What is this?

847
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,840
You don't know?

848
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,360
I know nothing about this letter.

849
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,300
Who wrote this?

850
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,570
As we expected, it's a trap...

851
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,550
A trap?

852
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,909
Toshi!

853
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,449
Run! Please hurry!

854
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:25,659
Toshi, do you doubt me?

855
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:27,390
I want to trust you.

856
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:33,039
That's why I came here to see for myself.

857
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:38,470
Did you come here alone?
Are you risking your life?

858
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:45,850
Toshi! I'm so glad!

859
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,829
Please trust me!

860
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:56,159
When I'm with you, I'm just a woman.

861
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:09,350
Hijikata, long time no see!

862
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:13,939
Glad we can see each other again.

863
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,000
Toshi, it's wrong!

864
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,449
Wait!

865
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,789
I'll do it!

866
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:55,050
If I kill the vice-leader of the
Shinsengumi, I'll become very famous!

867
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:01,890
Shichiri Kennosuke of Kogen
Itto Style will be famous.

868
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,319
vice-leader! vice-leader!

869
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:03,260
Let's go!

870
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,399
Please stay where you are.

871
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:19,270
I'm Detective Yamazaki Susumu.

872
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:25,010
I'd like to ask you a few questions, please
come with me to our headquarters!

873
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,689
Everyone, would you please excuse us?

874
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:56,810
When will the arson group get
together for their meeting?

875
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,109
What time will the meeting be?

876
01:11:58,949 --> 01:12:02,109
We won't accept that you
don't know. Go ahead tell us!

877
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:09,390
Not only are innocent people going
to suffer in the flames of the city...

878
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,090
but whether we are right or wrong...

879
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,109
the one thing that's certain is...

880
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:28,010
that the innocent townsfolk and
farmers shouldn't be caught up in this.

881
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:33,310
I see...

882
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,550
I really have to find out.

883
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,760
Toshi...

884
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:30,670
Don't let them torture her.

885
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,270
She's a woman!

886
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,470
She's not a woman...

887
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,779
she's our enemy.

888
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:47,979
The woman wants to talk to Hijikata.

889
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:02,560
Sae, I'm here! It's me!
Do you understand?

890
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,069
Oh, Toshi!

891
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:15,680
I don't care if I die, if I
can make you happy.

892
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:22,010
Today is the day that
they're getting together.

893
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,149
Today? You're certain?

894
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,560
It will be after sundown when the
people are all at the Gion Festival.

895
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:33,899
It will be five o'clock this night.

896
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:35,439
Where will they meet?

897
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:42,739
It will be at the Ikeda-ya
over by the Sanjo Kobashi...

898
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:44,369
Ikeda-ya?

899
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:47,210
Did you say Ikeda-ya?

900
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,449
Please do whatever you want with me!

901
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:57,489
I'm not going to try to escape.

902
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,430
Hold on, Sae!

903
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:04,170
Is she going to be all right?

904
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,569
If we treat her right way...

905
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:10,270
Please do that!

906
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:17,279
Tonight at 5 PM at the Ikeda-ya.

907
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:19,350
Ikeda-ya?

908
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:22,979
We never thought about that place.

909
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:24,949
Toshi...

910
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,220
Can we believe her?

911
01:15:50,109 --> 01:15:51,579
Have you heard anything
from the watchman?

912
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:53,420
No, we haven't heard anything yet.

913
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,750
We're running out of time!

914
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:59,560
Captain, we'll break into two teams.

915
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,390
Will you really go to Tantora?

916
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:06,159
Hijikata, don't you trust her?

917
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,170
No, it's not that!

918
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,640
But if we trust her and
all go to the Ikedaya...

919
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:16,170
and then find them at Tantora later,
the Shinsengumi's pride will suffer!

920
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:18,710
Captain, there's a man here to see you...

921
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:20,300
who was sent by Detective Matsudaira.

922
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,069
Excuse me!

923
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,949
Are you Detective Oki?

924
01:16:28,449 --> 01:16:32,460
We planned to send about
2ooo men to join you...

925
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,420
but it was a last minute decision.

926
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:39,529
We still don't know how we're going
to handle the confusion in town.

927
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:41,329
It's too late to worry about that now.

928
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:43,770
Anyway, the Shinsengumi
will take care of it!

929
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:49,210
Well, anyway, we tried to
hurry and did our best.

930
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,970
Excuse me.

931
01:16:54,779 --> 01:17:00,479
Leader, it's time to make a decision!

932
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,210
Toshi...

933
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:06,350
Let's do it!

934
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:11,119
Isami, this is going to be
our life's final gamble!

935
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,699
Yamanami, Okita,
Harada, Nagakura, Todo...

936
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,789
This group follows our
leader and goes to Ikeda-ya.

937
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:21,560
The rest of you will come
to Tantora with me!

938
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,939
Hijikata, you're not taking enough men!

939
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:25,279
Why don't you take the Okita group?

940
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:27,039
No, it's all right.

941
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:29,250
Both groups, if you arrive and
find there's nobody there...

942
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,180
you must go to the other place and
join the fight as soon as possible!

943
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,409
Don't let any of the enemy get outside!

944
01:17:34,579 --> 01:17:36,810
And don't count on the
men of Aizu Kawana!

945
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,720
We, the Shinsengumi must fight alone!

946
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,039
Where's the innkeeper? We're the
patrolmen of the Shinsengumi!

947
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,020
You! Shichiri...

948
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,420
Hijikata!

949
01:18:49,989 --> 01:18:51,760
I've been waiting for you!

950
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:53,630
Where is Kondo?

951
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,229
Where is Yabe Teizo?

952
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:56,800
Where's Yoshida, Kitazoe, Murayama...

953
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,869
Minister and assistant minister?
Where's everybody hiding?

954
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:01,460
Draw your sword and come over here!

955
01:19:03,069 --> 01:19:06,039
Did you take Furutaka
hostage and try to find us?

956
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:08,970
As we planned, he sent
you to Tantora, eh?

957
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:12,140
Hijikata, you're trapped!

958
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,579
Trapped?

959
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,159
The meeting place is Ikeda-ya!

960
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,289
What?

961
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:23,289
Sae answered my question
and told me it's Ikeda-ya!

962
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:25,460
Did Sae say that? You're lying!

963
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,729
Lying? Fool!

964
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:33,199
Kondo Isami and the Shinsengumi
are fighting at Ikeda-ya right now!

965
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,100
Damn you!

966
01:19:51,489 --> 01:19:53,390
Listen! Our men at the
Ikeda-ya are trapped!

967
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,720
Go over there and help them!

968
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:59,460
Shichiri! Running away!

969
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,229
You coward!

970
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,989
Shut up! Come to the Ikeda-ya!

971
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,829
I swear I'll kill you there!

972
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:08,189
Be careful!

973
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:11,909
When I finish here, the Ikeda-ya is next!

974
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,800
Friends, we're here to help you!

975
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,609
Hijikata, why are you here?

976
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:24,739
Why not?

977
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,750
Tonight's the night for the Shinsengumi!

978
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,149
And it's the chance of
a lifetime for me too!

979
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:33,989
I can't miss it!

980
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:08,390
Sir, please let me handle this!

981
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:13,119
You, go to the clan's main
house and bring more help!

982
01:26:04,029 --> 01:26:05,649
We've won...

983
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,359
I've won...

984
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,960
The Tennen Rishin won.

985
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,359
The Shinsengumi has won!

986
01:26:39,699 --> 01:26:43,760
What you said has come true, Toshi.

987
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,390
Your prediction has come true.

988
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:52,300
Something is bothering me,
there's somewhere I must go.

989
01:27:03,789 --> 01:27:04,779
Sae!

990
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,850
Sae!

991
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:19,390
What did you do?

992
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,539
Sae!

993
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:25,000
It's me!

994
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,409
I've killed you.

995
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:34,279
You said you just wanted to be a woman.

996
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:39,720
Hijikata Toshizo turned
you into a traitor...

997
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:42,289
and caused your death.

998
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:45,989
Sae!

999
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:49,789
Sae!

1000
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:38,140
What a tragic end this was.

1001
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,810
Sae...

1002
01:28:42,789 --> 01:28:44,750
Your life was full of pain...

1003
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:47,680
but thanks to you...

1004
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:54,989
the city of Kyoto has been
spared and her people are safe.

1005
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,600
Hijikata!
- Leave him alone.

1006
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:10,510
Isami, I must change myself!

1007
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:16,880
Tomorrow's Hijikata Toshizo must be
different from this Hijikata Toshizo.

1008
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,920
But one thing will never change.

1009
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,689
Our friendship...

1010
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:34,430
and the fellowship of Shinsengumi
can be torn apart only by death.

1011
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:50,439
But this was a young man's dream,
to belong to Shinsengumi...

1012
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:55,489
and live a full life with sword in hand.

1013
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:59,659
This day ended in victory at Ikeda-ya.

1014
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:03,899
But their swords could not
stem the tide of history...

1015
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,489
nor stop the rush of a changing world.

1016
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,260
Only three more years remained before
the Shogun's reign would come to an end.

1017
01:30:23,949 --> 01:30:30,220
