1
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,930
The endemic that only men were affected

2
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,770
is called Redface Pox.

3
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,010
Moreover, only young men
were affected with this disease.

4
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,640
Eight out of every ten
who fell victim to the plague died.

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,480
The male population of the country

6
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,080
continued to diminish at a frightening rate.

7
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,590
However, with no effective cure for it ever found,

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,660
the plague continued to spread
from the mountainous villages to all over Japan.

9
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,260
It was during the Shotoku era.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,130
The number of men

11
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:30,600
was down to only 1/4 of that of women.

12
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,620
"Never shall I speak of things I have seen or heard..."

13
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,540
"...inside the inner chambers..."

14
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,300
"...to my parents, my brothers or sisters..."

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,310
"...or to any other person beyond its walls."

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Bow down...

17
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,970
...for the entrance of our Liege!

18
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,420
<i><b><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</font>

19
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:13,300
Ooku - The Inner Chambers

20
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,410
Summer, Shotoku 5 (1975)

21
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,530
Hey, hey!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

22
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,460
Hold it tight!

23
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,560
Miss!

24
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,190
Please hang on!
Miss!

25
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,130
Miss!

26
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,030
Miss!

27
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,250
I give up!
I lose, Yunoshin!

28
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,790
What's this?
You've still got a lot of strength left.

29
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,920
Mitamura-san.

30
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,160
You dropped your sword on purpose, did you not?

31
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,030
Come! Another ten bouts.

32
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,100
Please spare me...

33
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,130
Deputy Master, shall we call it a day?

34
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,930
What?

35
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,540
I agree. This is enough!

36
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,570
Your passion for fencing
is indeed a madness.

37
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,270
Keeping you company
shall make everyone fall ill.

38
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,870
What? O-Nobu huh?

39
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,710
It's fine if you came bringing some food...

40
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,750
I have brought some rice balls for you.

41
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,350
Yes!
Practice is over!

42
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,350
Over~!!!

43
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,050
You indeed saved us all.

44
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,520
Thank you very much.

45
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,660
Delicious~

46
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,460
As expected,
O-Nobu's rice balls are really the best.

47
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,130
Speaking of which,

48
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,700
Mitamura-san's got some good muscles,

49
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,330
but he lacks mettle.
Or rather...

50
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,040
He has not experienced enough
the feeling when his life is at stake.

51
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,150
Of course not.

52
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
No one's life is at stake here.

53
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,810
Perhaps he might need it
if we were still in a time of war.

54
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,610
But in this day and age,

55
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,050
it is nothing more than
a samurai's accomplishment.

56
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,350
Why so...

57
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,290
Are you telling me
I'd better practice some singing or dancing?

58
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,830
I like your fencing...

59
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,890
...very much, sir.

60
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,000
However, you see,

61
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,440
while it's true that men are stronger than women,
their bodies are much weaker.

62
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,640
That is why,

63
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,340
I'm afraid you would get sick
if you push yourself too much.

64
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,850
Oh, but...

65
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,020
You too...

66
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,760
In order to give birth to healthy babies,

67
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,390
you have to keep well too.

68
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,050
You had better be good

69
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,020
and stop associating with me.

70
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,890
If so, from now onwards,

71
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,940
these mundane poor ladies
who favor you so much

72
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,570
will be bringing you rice balls, am I right?

73
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,040
I hope you liked the food.

74
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,880
May I please have a child.

75
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,860
May I please have a child.
May I please have a child.

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,760
May I please have a child.
May I please have a child.

77
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,300
Hey, hey, hey.
Am I the Buddha or something?

78
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,670
Regarding you, sir,

79
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,800
I doubt if there is such a divine Buddha like you.

80
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,140
The Buddhas I used to worship so much

81
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,180
have all turned crimson.

82
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,560
All my elder
and younger brothers,

83
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,260
everyone of the men

84
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,360
ended up being crippled
by that Redface demon.

85
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,830
O-Yae.

86
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,540
Do not worry.

87
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,240
You will definitely give birth
to a healthy child.

88
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,910
Even if you bear a baby boy,
Redface Pox can do no harm to him.

89
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,680
His mother must keep well,
so that she can raise up an excellent son.

90
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,940
Hey, take it back.
I said I require none of this.

91
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
That I cannot do, sir.

92
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,610
For someone of your stature, sir,

93
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,110
to accept having me on the same bed,

94
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,210
for just that much,
I cannot thank you enough.

95
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,680
Even the highest courtesan in Yoshiwara

96
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,620
could not have been better
to me than you were, sir.

97
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,420
That's shameful of them!

98
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,220
How can they be called courtesans

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,550
when they cannot even please a woman?

100
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,760
It's fine!
You keep this.

101
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,100
I am truly indebted to you, sir.

102
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,240
For giving a reason to go on living.

103
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,930
You are back home early.

104
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,330
There is very good news, Yunoshin.

105
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,210
This time, you have received yet
another very excellent offer of marriage.

106
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,740
You are still continuing that talk?

107
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,970
The other party is the daughter of Baron Miura of Hizen,

108
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,850
who is a commissioner of temples and shrines.

109
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,090
It seems that she is much attracted
to external appearance,

110
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,850
so as long as her groom-to-be is handsome,

111
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,980
she is willing to overlook all of his other defects.

112
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,790
Well, I am sure appreciative of that.

113
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,490
You are already 19 years old.

114
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,430
A proposal as opportune as this
will not come to us again.

115
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,790
How to put it...

116
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,140
I don't care about those things.

117
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,500
This is not a question of whether
you care about such things.

118
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,480
A man like you

119
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,410
must marry into a good family,

120
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,810
and then beget as many offspring
as his wife can bear.

121
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,780
That is the foremost thing.

122
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,680
Your infatuation with the daughter
of that merchant family is absurd.

123
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,260
Nevertheless, Mother,

124
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,860
is it not of the right order for you

125
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,220
to find a groom for my sister first?

126
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
That is not a matter for you to worry about.

127
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,660
You only need be concerned about yourself.

128
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,360
I have long wished

129
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,810
to express my deepest gratitude

130
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,030
to you, Mother.

131
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,050
In this era, should a poverty-stricken
samurai family raise a son,

132
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,380
it is like having a valuable studhorse,

133
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,820
and renting him out to generate money
is perfectly a matter of course.

134
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,550
And yet you, Mother,

135
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,560
have never once sold my body to strangers.

136
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,350
Never once.

137
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,200
I well know what that has meant

138
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,140
for our impoverished family...

139
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,280
Yunoshin...

140
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,780
Mother.

141
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,750
Please allow me to return
this great favor you have done me.

142
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,150
I shall find a more rewarding path for me

143
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,790
to spend my life,
one that is far more beneficial

144
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,220
to our family than a marriage.

145
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,570
He has grown into adulthood now.

146
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,700
Even if I said that,
how shall I go about doing it?

147
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,340
I can't keep wantoning away

148
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,420
like this any longer.

149
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,790
How unusual

150
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,860
or you to invite me out like this.

151
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,620
Is that so?

152
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
Indeed.

153
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,560
Today, there is that right?

154
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,740
The Night Festival.

155
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,070
Speaking of which, we used to
go out a lot in the old days.

156
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,210
Lately, it seems that
you have been quite busy at night.

157
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,080
You are so popular with the ladies,
are you not?

158
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,020
I know it.

159
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,680
That many women
have asked you for your seed,

160
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,990
and that you have never refused anyone.

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,430
That is not to mention this era we are living in.

162
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,900
Yet you never demand any payment from them.

163
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,730
Because I demand no payment, they all come to me.
Not because I'm popular or anything.

164
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,330
That is just like you.
You are very kind.

165
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,400
O-Nobu.

166
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,080
Those women

167
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,610
do not sleep with me because
they have love or passion for me.

168
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,380
I know that.

169
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,580
They just desire a child,

170
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,980
something that can give them a reason to live on.

171
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,150
For that sake,

172
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,190
they kneel down to someone like me.

173
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,830
Is it not heart-breaking?

174
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,930
How could I not lend them my help?

175
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,770
Well then,

176
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,780
...if I kneel down to you too,

177
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,640
would you...

178
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,480
...do it, sir?

179
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,120
O-Nobu...

180
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,320
If it is your wish,

181
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,990
I would not mind spending the night with you,

182
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,460
my dearest childhood friend.

183
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,880
You know very well

184
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,750
that is out of the question.

185
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,820
I certainly do.

186
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,830
You are the daughter of
a wealthy trader of medicinal herbs.

187
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,990
You are to wed a husband
from one of the big merchant families.

188
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Well, it would be bad for you to dally with

189
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,360
the son of a moneyless Hatamoto family like me.

190
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,910
Pitiless...

191
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,340
You are so very pitiless, sir!

192
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,560
The Inner Chambers?

193
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,540
Did you just say that, Yunoshin?

194
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,670
It is not like I'm going into the army,

195
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,070
I would be very bothered if you are that surprised.

196
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,280
I am already 19 this year.

197
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,870
It is considered late for a man of my age
to grow into manhood proper.

198
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,310
More importantly,
I ought to break with my trifling lifestyle,

199
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,180
and as a man, I feel obligated

200
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,380
to fully devote myself
for the sake of the family.

201
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,680
Should I be accepted into service in the Ooku,
I shall receive an allowance too.

202
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,060
Not only would you have one less mouth to feed,
I would also be able to send home money.

203
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,060
However, should you enter the Ooku,

204
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,220
unless it is for something so grave,

205
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,430
you would not be able to come out
even for a short leave.

206
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,230
Shinoya.

207
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,400
But... but...

208
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,900
Yunoshin.

209
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,570
You are sure your heart will not change?

210
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,910
Yes.

211
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,640
In this samurai household,

212
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,750
for you, Mother, who has tried your utmost
to protect my pride as a warrior,

213
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,250
and for Father and Sister too,

214
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,390
I am resolved that this is the only path
I could  go for the sake of you all.

215
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,630
Having you as my son...

216
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,340
is my utmost pride as a mother.

217
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,840
I shall keep those words at heart,

218
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,540
and exert myself to the best of my ability.

219
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,310
While in the Ooku,

220
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,880
you must protect our Shogun, without fail.

221
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,180
Mother.

222
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,550
Father.

223
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,620
Sister.

224
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,160
You have taken great care of me for so long.

225
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,090
Ah!

226
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,660
There you go.

227
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,290
How is it? See my new blue tonsure!

228
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,100
Makes me look even more manly,
don't you think?

229
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,930
So it is true...

230
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,940
right, sir...

231
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,610
You truly are going into the Ooku.

232
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,610
Lend me this, will you?

233
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,280
I will fix this sandal strap.

234
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,810
That is just like you.

235
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,850
Tell me, what shall I do
once you are gone?

236
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,790
Alright.

237
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,660
Like this, it will not snap anymore.

238
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,360
Alright.

239
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,360
Look!

240
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,160
What is it?

241
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,760
Do you yearn so much
to wear beautiful robes

242
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,700
and live in luxury?
Is that it?

243
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,270
You good-for-nothing!

244
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,730
Be well.

245
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,730
O-Nobu.

246
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,110
Sir...!

247
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,570
I shall be entering into service
as a page here.

248
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,160
My name is Mizuno Yunoshin.

249
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,560
I am a groom of the bedchamber.
My name is Matsushima.

250
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,110
Yes...!

251
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,620
Woah...

252
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,320
People usually say that

253
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,530
the Ooku is home to 3000 handsome men.

254
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,460
But in fact, that number amounts to not even 800.

255
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,170
These 800 men are, first,

256
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,170
divided into two categories,

257
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,470
those who are deemed noble
and worthy of our Liege's sight

258
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,240
and those who are unworthy our Liege's sight.

259
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,230
Yes.

260
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,410
And then these two categories...

261
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,750
are further broken down into
chamberlain, yeoman of the chamber,
groom of the bedchamber, valet of the chamber,

262
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,980
each of whom is in charge of specific duties.

263
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,390
For one who serves here
as a page like you,

264
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,150
your task shall be to take care of

265
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,220
your superiors' personal belongings.

266
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,990
While your rank is unworthy of our Liege's sight,

267
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,490
it is the highest position on that side.

268
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,860
As long as you are devoted,

269
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,760
it is no pipe dream that Her highness
might take a fancy to you.

270
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,730
Bear that in mind and work hard.

271
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,370
Yes.

272
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,500
You are stepping on my hem.

273
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,140
Oh. For this,

274
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,470
I beg your pardon, sir.

275
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,520
These are the seamsters.

276
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,900
They sew all the robes worn here in the Ooku.

277
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,310
Cleaning duties are assigned to houseboys.

278
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,040
Houseboys?

279
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,780
They are unworthy of our Liege's sight,

280
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
and have the lowest rank in the chambers.

281
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,710
Even these people and everyone else
are from very wealthy background

282
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,720
such as respectable families of merchants.

283
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,950
Those people there are also houseboys.
They are from the kitchen.

284
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,630
But indeed, there are scores of men here.

285
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,500
It makes one forget the fact that
the country is lacking men.

286
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
This is the place that house
those who are worthy of our Liege's sight.

287
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,010
Courtiers' Quarters.

288
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,110
That is the most powerful man
in all of the Ooku, Fujinami-sama.

289
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,210
Although the highest rank
belongs to the grand chamberlain,

290
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,220
...in actuality, the person who controls

291
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,050
...all the doings inside the Ooku

292
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,390
...is that person.

293
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,890
Yes.

294
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,160
I shall tell you one final thing.

295
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,130
Whatever you may see
or hear from now on in the Ooku...

296
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,970
...shall remain untold.

297
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,840
Break this pledge...

298
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,250
Your name is
Mizuno Yunoshin, is it not?

299
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,020
Yes.

300
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,330
It is a good name.

301
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,200
However, from now onwards,

302
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,900
you shall be called by
your surname, Mizuno, only.

303
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,640
As it is, "Mizuno" has a pleasing reverberation,

304
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,770
and is indeed a suitable name for the Ooku.

305
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,780
When people cast aside
the name used in their earthly life,

306
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,510
they are reborn.

307
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,520
All right, Mizuno?

308
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,020
Yes.

309
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,930
I am a newcomer here.
My name is Mizuno.

310
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,930
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

311
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,070
Such an indecently narrow topknot.

312
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,370
Behold the rough kimono he is wearing.

313
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,750
If you are a newcomer,

314
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,280
let me teach you the way of this place.

315
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,010
Yes, I am very grateful for that.

316
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,520
Firstly,

317
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,950
have off the hair on your legs.

318
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,450
The hair...?

319
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,760
Our current Shogun is still
a seven-year-old young maiden.

320
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,260
And one of the things
she dislikes is hairiness.

321
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,860
Oh...

322
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,960
I see.

323
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,800
Hey you,
they are just making fun of you.

324
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes?

325
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,370
If you shave the hair off,
you will feel itchy.

326
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,050
Seldom do we have someone so rustic here.

327
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,420
Most probably, he is the son
of an impoverished Hatamoto family,

328
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,280
pushed into this place so that
the family has one less mouth to feed.

329
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,150
Look at this, the color of his kimono.
He looks like a rat.

330
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,060
And then how narrow
this topknot is! It's disgraceful.

331
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,130
What is this for?

332
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,130
Trying to hide your
near-bald head, are you not?

333
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,460
Are you not?
Are you not?

334
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,670
That hurts...

335
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,470
Shame on you.

336
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,870
Who is the one that looks disgraceful?
You ugly toad!

337
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,310
Let me tell you
about the tonsure.

338
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,710
During times of war, men had to wear helmets
and so they shaved their hair

339
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,550
to keep their heads cool
under the iron helmets.

340
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,550
It is, so to speak,
the proof of a samurai!

341
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,950
And yet look at you.

342
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,690
At your age, you are wearing
the long topknot of a callow youth,

343
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,950
which in my eyes is far more revolting!

344
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,720
How dare you speak
to me like that?

345
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,060
Generally speaking,

346
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,230
I purposely wear my own topknot like this.

347
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,030
This is the most fashionable
hairstyle in Edo now.

348
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,960
And then this kimono is...

349
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,800
Well, it is certainly
not of the highest quality,

350
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,370
but its brownish grey color is the most in vogue,
and is worn by all the men in Edo.

351
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,310
So I ask you, who here
is the rustic bumpkin?

352
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,340
How dare you...!

353
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,580
Oh, shall we fight?

354
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,820
The afternoon duties are about to start.

355
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,990
I beg your pardon for not
having introduced myself earlier.

356
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,850
My name is Sugishita.

357
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,650
You had better go change your clothes fast.

358
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,610
You must not make a snapping noise like that.

359
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,850
Wipe the dust away with gentle strokes.

360
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,560
Another daily duty is to pass

361
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,530
the Masters' robes over scented smoke.

362
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,860
The... the Masters?

363
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,860
That means the gentlemen who are
worthy of our Liege's sight.

364
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,130
But, good grace...

365
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,440
there are so many goldfish
and cats in these chambers.

366
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,000
You have to call those "cats"
"Honorable Cats."

367
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,840
What?

368
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,110
That is one of the rule.

369
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,710
Then, it means that...

370
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,040
we have to call this
"Dear Honorable Goldfish?"

371
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,880
For someone who have been raised
as the cherished son of the Hatamoto,

372
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,250
perhaps you are not
accustomed to these things..

373
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,890
but it is not possible that
all the positions in the Ooku are glorious.

374
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,660
Oh no. These tasks
are downright easy.

375
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,090
My family is so poor
to the extent that is is laughable.

376
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,930
From working as a servant at the bathhouses
to scrubbing the boards covering the town sewers,

377
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,900
in short, I have done everything,
other than sell my body to women.

378
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,800
Alright.

379
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,390
Mizuno, fetch this to Matsushima-sama.

380
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,790
I understand.
Matsushima-sama, is it?

381
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,660
Matsushita-sama.

382
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,300
I have come fetching your supper...

383
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,180
Mine was brought to my chambers long ago.

384
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,850
Please pardon me for my mistake!

385
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,850
He has just entered the pages' quarters.
His name is Mizuno.

386
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,260
Quite a refreshing man, I must say.

387
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,740
Is that right?

388
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,780
What was that...

389
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,560
Is that so..?

390
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,070
So that is how it was...

391
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,440
Fire guards passing through!

392
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,770
Watchmen doing the rounds!

393
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,080
Guard you fire with care!
Be vigilant-!

394
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,450
Fire guards passing through!

395
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,090
Watchmen doing the rounds!

396
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,460
What is it?

397
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,100
Be obedient!

398
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,850
Ahh... in looks only...

399
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,120
What are you doing?

400
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,990
Pages who do not know where they stand

401
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,120
shall be disciplined like this.

402
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,700
Our Liege is only seven years old,

403
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,140
which means there is
practically no woman in this Ooku.

404
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,710
Do you understand now?

405
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,580
We rub a man's buttocks hole
with clove oil

406
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,680
to make it feel like a woman's body.

407
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,220
Let me go.

408
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,820
Is it dreadful? Hmm?

409
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,400
You fool.
Are you insane?

410
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,800
Drawing one's sword in the Ooku
is strictly forbidden!

411
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,070
Shut your mouth!

412
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,500
If I am compelled to commit harakiri later,

413
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,840
then I'll slay the three of you
first before going to hell.

414
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,510
This is not merely a threat.

415
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,750
If you dare to try this again with me,

416
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,250
I will absolutely cut the lot of you down.

417
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,460
It's terribly noisy!

418
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,590
Don't be bothered
so much by last night's happening.

419
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,630
It is commonplace in the Inner Chambers.

420
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,360
Is that really so?

421
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,490
Many times I have laid with men myself.

422
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,770
If you are fortunate enough to become friendly
with a chamberlain or groom of the bedchamber,

423
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,810
you might have the chance of
getting promoted in the ranks.

424
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,540
That is the reason why so many here
in the Ooku have kept their forelocks.

425
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,210
What is this...

426
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,280
If you could just take one step
out of the Edo Castle,

427
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,290
there are numbers of woman
who are desperate to bear children

428
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,890
but are unable to due to lack of seed.

429
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,720
I cannot do it...

430
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,830
I cannot act as if
I can wastefully throw my seed in vain.

431
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,010
We are only goldfish.

432
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,010
We are useless creatures, kept
in the goldfish bowl that is the Ooku.

433
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,580
And our job is merely to be kept.

434
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,520
Having so many man together
is to no earthly avail.

435
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,090
And they let their precious seed go to waste.

436
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,730
However, this very wastefulness
is the extravagance of this world,

437
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,860
It is the evidence of our Shogun's
might and power, is it not?

438
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,780
Begin!

439
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,110
I accept my defeat!

440
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,300
Good posture.

441
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,000
You certainly have skills.

442
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,630
Fujinami-sama...

443
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,920
There, there.
Lift your head.

444
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,610
Yes, sir.

445
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,890
What is your name?

446
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,260
My name is Mizuno.

447
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,720
Mizuno...

448
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,660
Oh...

449
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,930
You are Mizuno, that page?

450
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,240
I have heard rumors about you.

451
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,600
Instead of performing the night duties,
you fought them off brilliantly.

452
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,400
Yes...

453
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,940
How about this, Mizuno.

454
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,950
Will you not step into the fencing hall
and have a bout with one of them?

455
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,750
However, my Lord,

456
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,950
I belong to the rank
that is unworthy of our Liege's sight.

457
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,560
The Ooku is, by nature,

458
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,180
the place where the men shall tender
Her highness with utmost security.

459
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,260
This is an extremely important mission.

460
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
I will make an exception for you.

461
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,640
Now, among all of
the men present here today,

462
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,270
who is the one with the most
brilliant skill?

463
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,340
Yes.

464
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,610
That person is Tsuruoka.

465
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,380
Tsuruoka, have a bout with Mizuno.

466
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,850
Yes.

467
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,500
His first opponent is Tsuruoka?

468
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,070
The odds are against the newcomer?

469
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,740
This is worth watching.

470
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,700
Begin!

471
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,950
As expected of Tsuruoka.

472
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,350
He did not even glance at the opening
Mizuno purposely created for him.

473
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,450
Though looking quite light,
he has a body...

474
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,060
that cannot be built
without daily practice.

475
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,550
Mizuno wins!

476
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,650
Excellent, Mizuno!

477
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,830
I am terribly sorry.

478
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,730
Since you have such tremendous strength,

479
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,140
I was unable to stop my sword completely.

480
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,380
And also,
allow me to thank you...

481
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,540
Encountering someone with
such exquisite swordsmanship like you,

482
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,050
I am truly very happy!

483
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,950
Then...

484
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,990
Please grab my hand...

485
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
What swordsmanship..!

486
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,330
Don't get so full of yourself.

487
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,500
It is far more important in this Inner Chambers,

488
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,610
to have a beautiful face and impeccable manner.

489
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,210
Regarding beauty,

490
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,190
I am far above you.

491
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,820
Matsushima-sama...

492
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,030
You have worked hard, Tsuruoka.

493
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,960
It was a good match.

494
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,360
No, but I...

495
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,500
Well, Mizuno was just
a little more skillful than you.

496
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,170
There is nothing to fret about.

497
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,570
Matsushima-sama...

498
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,000
Do not touch me.

499
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,580
It is unsightly.

500
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,910
O-Nobu...

501
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,140
This place is dark.

502
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,550
Even though it is crowded with men
who are blessed with such beauty and talent

503
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,850
that can dazzle one this much,

504
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,350
everyone's heart is dark.

505
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,830
I'm from a low-raking vassal family with an income of
thirty bales of rice, just enough for three people.

506
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,470
Even among the low-ranking vassal family,
there is no lower stipend than that.

507
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,980
What's more, my parents, unlike your own,

508
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,350
forced me to lie with women
every night for money.

509
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,310
Every night ever since I turned 14.

510
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,720
There were some women
who would press red hot fire irons on me.

511
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,030
There were some who have diseases.

512
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,730
When I was married off at the age of 18,

513
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,860
I could finally escape that dreadful hell.

514
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,500
I was really happy.

515
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,440
But after several years of marriage,
we were still without child.

516
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,170
In the end,

517
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
they put the blame on my lack of seed.

518
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,510
And I was divorced.

519
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,180
In the last months I spent there,
I was hardly given anything to eat.

520
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,360
It was impossible for me to go back
to the penniless house of my parents.

521
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,960
And so when I was 23,

522
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,560
I entered here into
the lowest rank of houseboys.

523
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,560
Washing and scrubbing heavy pots
and buckets or any other physical work,

524
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,210
mingling with sons of merchants,
sometimes getting raped by the seniors here,

525
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,710
all of these did not inflict on me any longer.

526
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,320
Perhaps to you, the Ooku...

527
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,880
...may seem a hateful,

528
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,620
thoroughly revolting and rotten place.

529
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,670
But there are people
who cannot live their lives anywhere else.

530
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,760
Woah! That is Mizuno-sama!

531
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,520
He is so handsome~!
What shall I do~!

532
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,290
They are your admirers.

533
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,790
My admirers?

534
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,590
Words about your match
with Tsuruoka-sama the other day

535
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,260
have been spread around
and garnered much admiration.

536
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,370
Someone, go there.

537
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,230
Then, Kakizoe, you go!

538
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,270
Ah...
I am terribly sorry.

539
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,770
Oh no big deal.
Never mind that.

540
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,950
Excuse me...

541
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,880
Since it has gotten cold lately,

542
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,190
please do take care not to catch a cold, sir.

543
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,220
Yeah. Thank you.

544
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,590
Kakizoe, you did it!
You did well!

545
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,220
He is so handsome.

546
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:49,221
<i><b><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</font>
<font color=red>Aldi Arman</font></b></i>

547
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,810
I have been waiting for you, Mizuno.

548
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,880
Tsuruoka-sama?

549
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,290
Mizuno.

550
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,700
Fight with me one more time.

551
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,470
You have taken away my position.

552
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,040
There is no chance I could ever forgive that.

553
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,980
Please stop this, Tsuruoka-sama.

554
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:54,750
This is inside the castle...

555
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:55,620
Be quiet!

556
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,660
How could you understand how I feel?

557
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,230
Do you know...

558
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,670
how much I have had to withstand
in order to be where I am today?

559
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,850
Please refrain yourself.

560
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,490
There is absolutely no reason for me

561
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,750
to fight you, sir!

562
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,830
Draw your sword, Mizuno!

563
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,060
I cannot do that.

564
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,700
This sword is...

565
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,540
for the sake of protecting our Liege.

566
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,840
I cannot not draw this sword!

567
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,190
Die.

568
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,240
Please...

569
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,110
put your sword back, Tsuruoka-sama.

570
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,750
As her samurai,

571
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,590
let us protect our Liege together.

572
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,910
Do not come near.

573
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,510
I have heard about it...

574
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,550
That Tsuruoka suddenly attacked you,

575
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,310
and that he ended his life
by committing suicide.

576
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:29,820
No.

577
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,660
That is decidedly not true, sir.

578
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,390
I also heard your cheek has gotten a cut...

579
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:42,960
There is no such thing, sir.

580
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,410
Then it is fine.

581
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,920
I will convey to Fujinami-sama
and the Outer Chambers

582
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,220
that Tsuruoka has passed away
due to grave illness.

583
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,860
The same thing will be conveyed
to Tsuruoka's family.

584
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,260
Yes.

585
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:34,900
<i>The seventh Shogun of Tokugawa
Tokugawa Ietsugu</i>

586
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:50,020
<i>The Shogun's Privy Councilor
Manabe Akifusa</i>

587
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,130
My poor Liege.

588
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,040
Ietsugu-sama...

589
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,640
Ietsugu-sama...

590
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,040
Her highness has passed away
earlier that we could have thought.

591
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,680
It has been decided that

592
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,220
the succeeding shogun
will be Lord Yoshimune from Kii Province.

593
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,460
Since a new shogun will be crowned,

594
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,090
the Ooku will also be made anew.

595
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,660
Before long, we would not have
so much free time on our hands anymore.

596
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,270
I wonder about that.

597
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,910
It is said that

598
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,610
she is very thrifty.

599
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,280
I heard Lord Yoshimune

600
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,550
even said that renewing
the Inner Chambers

601
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:43,390
is a waste of the country's resources.

602
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,690
Is that truly so?

603
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,760
According to what I have heard,
Lord Yoshimune

604
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,190
of the heads of the three branch houses,

605
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,960
was the first to reach Edo Castle
when our Liege just passed away.

606
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,500
The Kii province bribed one of the chief retainers

607
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,440
to intentionally delay the report
of our Liege's critical condition

608
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,540
to other branches.

609
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,870
Is that right..

610
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,880
Women are pernicious.

611
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:57,900
Bow down...

612
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,470
...to the entrance of our Liege.

613
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,180
Your Highness.

614
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,180
How does this swept-up gown please you?

615
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,920
Manabe, you mean this uchikake over-garment?

616
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,450
Yes.

617
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,350
This is the custom here in the castle to call it so,

618
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,360
for one sweeps up the hem of it
with one's hands when walking.

619
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,720
It's beautiful.

620
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,140
However, Manabe,

621
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,430
I am sure I have told you the other day

622
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,940
that I require no luxurious garments.

623
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,400
With all due respect,

624
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,740
I believe I have faithfully
followed your command

625
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,850
that your robes be
the most simple, my Liege.

626
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,180
However,

627
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,780
anything simpler than this
would be deemed humble,

628
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,380
and it will mar your great reputation, my Liege.

629
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:04,060
This place is not the same
as the hinterlands of Kii province.

630
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,770
I understand.

631
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,280
Then there is nothing to be done about it.

632
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,480
I am most grateful.

633
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,550
Your understanding is above all else.

634
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,920
Well then, Manabe Akifusa.

635
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,750
Pack your belongings and be gone
by the end of the day.

636
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,090
Pardon me?

637
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,660
At this time when there are
unprecedented economic hardships,

638
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,070
for one who is charged with
ruling the nation and rebuilding its finances

639
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,240
to pad around dressed in such extravagance,

640
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:47,740
it seems to me that that
this is something only a lunatic will do.

641
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,680
And it strikes me that

642
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:54,650
you are afflicted with precisely such lunacy.

643
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,350
I cannot have such a madwoman like you

644
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,660
serve me as a privy councilor
which is an important government post, can I?

645
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,530
This is...

646
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,930
Did you not hear me?

647
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,930
Disappear from my sight.

648
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,600
Yes.

649
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,130
<i>Later to become Yoshimune's Intermediary

00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:36,780
that Her highness

652
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,760
shall not hold an audience
in the inner chambers for some time?

653
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,120
As for Her highness,

654
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,130
since she is much occupied
with affairs of the state...

655
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,860
However, Kano-dono,

656
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,270
our shogun has been into
her reign for ten days,

657
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:56,210
and she has not once seen fit to hold
a general audience in the inner chambers...

658
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,580
Well, but this is not as though
she will never come here, sir...

659
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,340
I should think not!

660
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,610
I cannot help but think that
the conduct of our Liege in this instance

661
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,120
will lead to others' heaping
scorn on the inner chambers.

662
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,050
What on earth
could Her highness be thinking?

663
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,730
The future of this country.

664
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,180
Would you not like some flowers?

665
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,350
Let see, let see.

666
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,220
Today it is quite dusty around here.

667
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,990
Ah! I am so sorry!

668
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:51,390
Do not be bothered.

669
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,370
You indeed have vigor.

670
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,970
If only the women in this country

671
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,470
have the same liveliness as yours.

672
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:15,320
Selling oil and sauce~
Please buy our oil!

673
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,060
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

674
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,600
Stop running!

675
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,300
Don't block the way!
Wait, you rascal!

676
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,770
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

677
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,070
Wait, you thief!

678
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,570
Do not be so tense, Saburoza.

679
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,980
Being under your protection
in my every step

680
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,650
I find it much less pleasurable
to travel incognito.

681
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,750
I humbly beg your pardon.

682
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,120
I have always wanted to know...

683
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,660
...how the people in this country
make their living.

684
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,160
I wonder how that must feel like...

685
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,960
For a mother,

686
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,290
perhaps it is her utmost wish
to have her son

687
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:25,690
survive by all means.

688
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,730
Recently, Redface Pox
has been spreading quite rapidly again.

689
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:32,300
Thus, the number of men continues to decline.

690
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,260
Attract more customers for me!

691
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,200
You too!

692
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,270
Both of them are such excellent men~

693
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,500
That is right.

694
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:12,240
As expected of Master.
Our young Master has such a discerning eye.

695
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,840
Our eyes met!

696
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:22,950
Is it not alright?
Just enter our store~

697
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,100
Even in such a condition...

698
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,730
they still have to be doing all this...

699
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:41,200
Do not talk back to me!

700
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,610
Quickly go and come back,
you moron!

701
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,280
Wait a moment!

702
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,450
I hear that one in five people can survive.

703
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,460
Take care of yourself.

704
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:19,030
My Liege,

705
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:23,970
<i>Later to become Edo Capital's Magistrate
Ooka Tadasuke</i>

706
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:24,470
I would like to express my gratitude
for your utmost hard work today.

707
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,780
Are you dissatisfied because
I went out to the street, Echizen?

708
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,720
Nothing can be further
from the truth than that.

709
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,850
However, before long,

710
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,920
you might want to consider
visiting the Inner Chambers, my Liege.

711
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,920
That is what Echizen-dono
has been contemplating.

712
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,190
O-Nobu-sama.

713
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,500
As the ruler, I ought to resolve
urgent matters at hand.

714
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,740
I am not in the position
that allows me to deal with men now.

715
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,230
With all due respect,

716
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:54,110
Holding a morning's audience is also
a task a ruler must do.

717
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:59,180
That is indeed correct,
O-Nobu-sama.

718
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,080
Call me "Your Highness."

719
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:09,120
I am promoted to...
a groom of the bedchamber?

720
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,420
Absolutely.

721
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:15,590
This time, you will finally
be able to appear in front of Her highness.

722
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,630
Afterwards, through that way,

723
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:20,600
you would be considered together with
other grooms of the Bedchamber.

724
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,130
If you are lucky enough
to become her bed partner,

725
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,670
you might even ascend to the position
of the Father of the Successor.

726
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:30,440
Oh...

727
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:35,250
Fujinami-sama has been extremely pleased

728
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:39,490
to have been acquainted with
an excellent samurai like yourself.

729
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,100
Welcome back, sir.

730
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,510
Allow me congratulate you
on your promotion.

731
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,750
Master.

732
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,080
Oh, no...

733
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,850
You need not call me Master...

734
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:10,520
From now onwards,

735
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,590
I have been commanded by Fujinami-sama

736
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,520
to serve as your personal attendant.

737
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,120
And as of today,

738
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,760
I have been elevated
to the rank of cupbearers.

739
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,930
I always expected to end my days
here in the pages' quarters.

740
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,530
This is more than I ever dared
to hope to attain.

741
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,970
Master, allow me to direct you
to your new apartment...

742
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:38,380
Alright.

743
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:02,100
This time,
I have been assigned

744
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,270
to tailor your formal attire,
Mizuno-sama.

745
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,410
My name is Kakizoe.

746
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,250
Oh.
You are...?

747
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:16,150
I shall exert myself
to the best of my ability.

748
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,230
Considering your features,

749
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,540
I would suggest that strong colors
be most suitable for you.

750
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,310
Perhaps a scarlet
or maybe a deep blue...

751
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,340
No.

752
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,280
I want black.

753
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:46,710
Black?

754
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,450
As for the pattern,

755
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,220
I want something large and bold,
in just one or two places...

756
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:56,290
Can you make a formal attire
as I have just described?

757
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,800
What would you think of such a design?

758
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,970
A black background, upon which
a single large pattern of a flowing water

759
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:10,240
is dyed in a somber,
smoked silver on the back...

760
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,810
And then, gold...
No, a golden brown?

761
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,180
No, all will be black.

762
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,480
I beg your pardon, sir!

763
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,880
I did not mean to annoy you
with my endless rambling.

764
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,820
No.
I like it.

765
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,520
I like your proposal.

766
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,290
You have a surprisingly great taste.

767
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:35,500
Very swell.
I shall leave it in your hands.

768
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,370
Do it as you see fit.

769
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:03,480
Everyone,

770
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,750
this is the newly appointed groom
of the bedchamber.

771
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,320
Mizuno.

772
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,320
My name is Mizuno,

773
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,260
In the coming days,

774
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:17,170
I hope to receive your kind guidance.

775
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,620
Mizuno.

776
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,200
Is this the first time you play
the three-incense game?

777
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,900
Yes.

778
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,730
Then, try it out.

779
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,840
Well, all we do
is sniff each of three censers

780
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:02,810
and then guess whether
the three fragrances are like or unlike.

781
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,380
Yes.

782
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,190
If you think of each of
the three fragrances is unlike the others,

783
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,200
you answer by drawing
three vertical lines like this.

784
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:20,230
This is called
"Dew on Flowering Silvergrass."

785
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:25,170
And, if you think
all three fragrances are identical,

786
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,680
you join the tops of
the three lines like this.

787
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,650
This is called "Evergreen Grove."

788
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,980
Well, how about when the first
and the third ones are the same?

789
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,150
Then it's "Snow on the Peak."

790
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,250
Oh, I understand now.

791
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:41,990
Oh, indeed, the design

792
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:44,390
looks like a hill tipped with snow.

793
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:46,790
Oh~

794
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,960
How is it, Mizuno?

795
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:20,700
Is it by any chance,
"Snow on the Peak?"

796
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,900
Indeed it is.

797
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,200
As expected of you, Mizuno!

798
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:29,600
Yes!

799
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,940
How is it, Matsushima?

800
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:39,180
Mizuno is a pretty interesting fellow.

801
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:40,780
Is that right?

802
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,480
My eyes has certainly
not deceived me in the least.

803
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,010
If it is him,

804
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,880
he will surely catch our Liege's attention.

805
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,160
What is the matter?

806
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,420
Even for someone like you,

807
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:00,400
are you perturbed by the fact that
Mizuno would become your rival?

808
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,010
No, sir.

809
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,940
It's merely that,
I have yet to fathom your true intention.

810
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,140
I will place this here, sir.

811
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,490
This is...

812
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,750
How does it please you, sir?

813
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,300
Yeah..
I like it.

814
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:13,570
The tailoring is very thorough.
As expected of a seamster of the Ooku!

815
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,470
You are showering me
with more praises than what I deserve, sir.

816
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:20,150
Oh. I shall give you something
as a token of my appreciation.

817
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:25,020
Speaking of which, where are
the cookies I received the other day...

818
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,420
Huh? Wait a minute...
Where did they go?

819
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,420
Mizuno-sama.

820
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,190
I need nothing...

821
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,100
I do not desire anything.

822
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,270
But..

823
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,620
But what?

824
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,880
Just a memory...

825
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:37,120
Ah... I can't give you...
anything more than this.

826
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,930
No...

827
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,300
I will cherish this memory
for the rest of my life.

828
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:53,710
Well...

829
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,950
That was no big deal.

830
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,510
Hey, do not laugh.

831
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,910
I said do not laugh!

832
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,880
Everyone looks so splendid~

833
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,510
Let us see yours.

834
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,150
This is the first morning's audience.
I am really nervous~

835
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,690
Look at you, Matsushima-sama.
The light purple color of your costume suits you perfectly.

836
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,020
Yours too.

837
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,490
A somber black color..?

838
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,430
It is certainly unusual...

839
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,000
What a somber costume.
And it looks quite seedy too.

840
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,770
Perhaps he deliberately wears this
to attract attention,

841
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:36,670
but with that costume...?

842
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,010
Mizuno!

843
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,290
That jet black costume...

844
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,190
suits the brightness here very much.

845
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:56,020
I am much obliged to you
for your great consideration.

846
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,030
And then, Mizuno,
I shall tell you this one thing.

847
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:13,970
During the morning's audience,
if Her Highness asks someone for his name,

848
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,450
then that is a sign.

849
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:20,640
A sign?

850
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:31,490
Her highness shall now enter
for the morning's audience.

851
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,310
Bow down...

852
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,050
...for the entrance of our Liege.

853
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,660
Heaven's sake.

854
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,230
What a bunch of garish overdressed men.

855
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,740
Your Highness!

856
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,210
I am all right.

857
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:11,160
The person who laughed just now.
Who was it?

858
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,500
Who was it?

859
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,850
That was me, your highness.

860
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,590
I most humbly

861
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,360
beg your pardon.

862
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,770
It was me who laughed just now.

863
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:12,530
Raise your head.

864
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,760
Yes.

865
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,440
Fret not.

866
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:24,370
Show me your face.

867
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:41,160
You there,

868
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,680
what is your name?

869
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,270
I am most honored, your Highness.

870
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:03,040
My name is Mizuno.

871
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:09,480
Have you heard that, Fujinami?

872
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,420
Yes!

873
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,060
Your Highness.

874
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:01,060
Was there some happy occurrence at
this morning's general audience?

875
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:04,670
Indeed.

876
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:08,070
It seems that I am still a woman.

877
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,840
Does that mean

878
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,770
you have already taken a fancy
to one of the men ?

879
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,360
However, if I am right...

880
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,750
What is the matter, Hisamichi?

881
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:30,030
Yes. Um...

882
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,190
If I am right,

883
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:38,300
the first man chosen by an unmarried shogun
to be her companion in the bedchamber

884
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:41,940
is called "the Secret Swain."

885
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,840
The Secret Swain?

886
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,450
The Secret Swain

887
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,480
must forfeit his life.

888
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:58,720
And that means,
you will be secretly decapitated.

889
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,500
While the Secret Swain...

890
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,600
serves a most important mission, that is,

891
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,440
to initiate the maiden Shogun
into the ways of the Bedchamber,

892
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:14,540
at the same time, he is marring her virginity

893
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:18,380
and hence injuring her person,
which is indeed a horrendous crime.

894
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,710
And for this reason,

895
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:24,620
the Secret Swain must forfeit his life.

896
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,560
This was decreed during
the reign of the third shogun, Lord Iemitsu.

897
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:31,960
And it is stated in the Ooku code.

898
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:41,000
Do you have anything to say?

899
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:54,710
What will my family be told...

900
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,440
...about my death, sir?

901
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:02,010
That you fell ill.

902
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:06,360
Under no circumstances
will matters pertaining to our Liege

903
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:08,290
ever be made known outside the Ooku.

904
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,820
If I may make one more query,

905
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,400
as the blood relations of one

906
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,030
who has committed a horrendous crime,

907
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:19,370
by any chance,
must my family bear a similar price?

908
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,810
None.

909
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,510
Your parents' family

910
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:25,410
will receive a pretty sum of money

911
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,640
as a token of our condolences.

912
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,550
I shall guarantee that.

913
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:42,490
Then if that is the case,
it it good enough.

914
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,100
I most humbly

915
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,000
accept the honor of fulfilling this duty
for which I have been chosen.

916
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,010
You're praise-worthy!

917
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:00,670
This is inhuman!
What inhumanity!

918
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,950
No.

919
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,280
It does not seem to me that

920
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:07,450
the events of this morning's general audience
were arranged beforehand.

921
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,880
However, it does not change the fact
that since the beginning,

922
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,390
Fujinami-sama has wanted Master
to be the Secret Swain,

923
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,080
and that must have been why he made you
a groom of the Bedchamber.

924
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,620
Had you not been promoted,

925
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,920
the Secret Swain would have been chosen

926
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,530
among the current
Grooms of the Bedchamber!

927
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,530
Nonetheless, since Fujinami-sama...

928
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,900
has received vast sums from noble samurai families

929
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,530
whose sons are Grooms of the Bedchamber,

930
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,810
he has intentionally raised you up
to be a sacrifice...

931
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:35,540
Is that not self-interested?

932
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,250
Is that not ruthless and outrageous?

933
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,390
I beg of you...

934
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,240
Please say nothing more.

935
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,400
My heart is about to crumble...

936
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,250
Please forgive me...

937
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:20,320
for the foolish words I have spoken.

938
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,760
Sugishita...

939
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,270
Do not let this happen to you.

940
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:53,550
Indeed.

941
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,550
I was indeed overcome with terror
at the morning's audience~!

942
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,460
Truly, sir.

943
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:03,800
If Mizuno had been punished
for his insolent breach of manners,

944
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:06,700
all of your scheming up until now
would have been wasted.

945
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,140
In any case,
at the next morning's audience,

946
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,080
After I make a recommendation
about you to Her Highness,

947
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:19,550
Matsushima,

948
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:23,420
you shall become
the Father of the succeeding Shogun.

949
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,490
Finally,

950
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:28,750
I can then repay the kindness
that you have bestowed me with, Fujinami-sama.

951
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,510
O-Nobu...

952
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,020
If I had known it would come to this,

953
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,790
I would have shared the night with you.

954
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:07,970
I love you.

955
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,340
I always wanted

956
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:23,280
to tell you how much I love you.

957
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,590
Sir!

958
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:29,420
I have brought some rice balls for you.

959
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,760
This is enough, sir!

960
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:35,660
Because you always forget
about your own unfortunate circumstance...

961
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:00,620
Allow me to wash your back, Master.

962
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:50,670
Please close your eyes.

963
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,570
It is known that Lord Yoshimune
is a wild and violent woman.

964
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:57,130
Take care not to let her
squeeze every last drop of life out of you.

965
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,360
It would be a pity if you die even
before your sentence.

966
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,570
What is this?

967
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:04,640
Even though you are a monk,
you are speaking in such a lewd manner.

968
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,840
Just so you know,
like us who serve as eunuchs,

969
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,150
if you are unable to
perform your function as man tonight,

970
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:15,050
it would be this.

971
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,520
I need not you to worry.
You crude monk.

972
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,820
Well then, please do serve her well.

973
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:05,370
Be at ease.
Raise your head.

974
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:07,130
Yes.

975
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,580
Do not be bothered
by the attending monks.

976
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:13,800
Loosen up.

977
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,050
Even if I say that,
perhaps it is impossible to do.

978
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,240
Nonetheless, let us try as best as we can.

979
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,560
What is your personal name?

980
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:29,590
My personal name is Nobu.

981
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:39,070
Then, what is your personal name?

982
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,640
I am most grateful...

983
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,480
It's Yunoshin.

984
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:57,620
Mizuno Yunoshin is my name
before I entered the chambers.

985
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,150
Yunoshin...

986
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,590
Is that not a good name?

987
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,300
Well then, Yunoshin,

988
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,500
are both your parents
in good health?

989
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:15,370
Yes.

990
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,870
They live near the castle,
and are in perfectly good health.

991
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:29,280
Then this will...

992
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,520
...cause them great distress.

993
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,130
Yunoshin.

994
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:44,300
When I asked you your name this morning,

995
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:47,830
I did not know
it bring bring this consequence.

996
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:52,910
I have indeed

997
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,840
condemned you to a bitter fate,
and for that you cannot reproach enough.

998
01:33:58,590 --> 01:34:00,080
However, this task...

999
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,820
definitely has to be
undertaken by someone...

1000
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:10,490
This is still a most atrocious thing...

1001
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:15,690
Forgive me.

1002
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:26,010
Please, your highness...

1003
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,080
I am not worthy of
such merciful words of yours.

1004
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,390
But if...

1005
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,760
If I may beg you...

1006
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:47,530
to favor me with one more kindness...

1007
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,570
Tell me what it is.

1008
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,770
Do allow me to...

1009
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:05,580
For this one night,

1010
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:11,450
please do accept this wish of mine
to call you O-Nobu.

1011
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,060
Please do accept it.

1012
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:41,620
All of you there, listen well!

1013
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,390
It is indeed true that requesting a favor...

1014
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:47,890
...in the Bedchamber
is prohibited by the Ooku code.

1015
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,700
But this man here...

1016
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:54,970
...has been sentenced to die
in no time.

1017
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:59,140
If I cannot accept this small wish
of a man who is on the verge of death,

1018
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:01,310
what kind of Shogun am I!

1019
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:16,320
Very well then, Yunoshin.

1020
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:20,990
I doubt that something as trifling as this...

1021
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,730
could release you
from your despair, but...

1022
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:29,440
At least...

1023
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:32,910
At least...

1024
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,010
O-Nobu!

1025
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,460
Your duty last night
has concluded smoothly, sir.

1026
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,870
You have performed you duty well.

1027
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:45,700
Where is Her highness...?

1028
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,910
Regarding Her highness,

1029
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:49,640
she has commanded just now that

1030
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,250
you be left to sleep in peace, sir.

1031
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:13,300
Saburoza. There is something
I would like you to look into.

1032
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:15,070
Yes.

1033
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:44,530
Are there any final words you wish to speak?

1034
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:50,370
No.

1035
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:55,110
There are not.

1036
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:19,430
Well then...

1037
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:13,450
No good.
What a bad omen.

1038
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:30,860
Your son...

1039
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:34,210
Regarding Mizuno Yunoshin-sama,

1040
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:36,060
he has been in good health
in the Ooku,

1041
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:38,370
exerting himself to the best
of his ability while serving there.

1042
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,800
However, at the beginning of the fall,
he became consumptive

1043
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:47,080
All the treatment was to no avail,
hence he has passed away.

1044
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:01,290
This is his hair that is left behind.

1045
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,840
You have done such folly, sir,

1046
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:21,680
doing as you please and
going to so far a place all by yourself.

1047
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:27,790
But you know,

1048
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,420
I...

1049
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:34,690
will go on living even though
you are no longer here.

1050
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,730
Because, unlike men,

1051
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,540
women are strong beings.

1052
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,210
That's right!

1053
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:06,560
Sir...

1054
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:10,100
I have brought you some rice balls.

1055
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,570
I am thankful for that.

1056
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,550
I have been secluded...

1057
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,780
in this unknown temple for a while now.

1058
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,050
It has been quite constrictive for me.

1059
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,560
Been a long time
since I last ate white rice.

1060
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:44,890
Hmm!

1061
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:54,330
How come?

1062
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:56,900
Hmm~ delicious!

1063
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,010
As I thought,

1064
01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:01,670
the rice balls O-Nobu makes
are indeed the best.

1065
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:10,080
But how...

1066
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,180
That I cannot tell you.

1067
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:16,360
Well, I have always been
a tradesman called Shinkichi

1068
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,260
and have been your well-matched
confidant since childhood.

1069
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:36,580
Sir!

1070
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:22,660
You are dead.

1071
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:27,300
Mizuno,
the Groom of the Bedchamber,

1072
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,030
has died here today.

1073
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:35,670
From now on,
you will take on a new name,

1074
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:38,380
become a different person,

1075
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:44,550
and start a new life in the world.

1076
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:50,790
You shall wed your childhood friend O-Nobu.

1077
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:54,130
As Yunoshin...

1078
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:56,560
No...

1079
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:00,730
As a tradesman
with the name of Shinkichi.

1080
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,620
Regarding the matter this time,

1081
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,560
I am not impressed,
your Highness.

1082
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:59,250
Why, Echizen?

1083
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,360
From now on,

1084
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:03,690
for such frivolous matters,

1085
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,460
please refrain yourself from

1086
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,330
using the services of
the secret guard, Saburoza.

1087
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:11,530
You are forever a woman
with no sense of mirth.

1088
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:13,840
I still have to say...

1089
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:17,810
The Inner Chambers are an even more
terrible place than it was rumored.

1090
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:21,040
To toss away the life of a young man

1091
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:24,610
as if his life is completely a piece of litter...

1092
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:26,980
Verily so.

1093
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,380
Hisamichi.

1094
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:37,550
Select and gather 50 beautiful men
for me immediately.

1095
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,560
I shall hold an audience.

1096
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:50,210
It is finally starting.

1097
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,570
Yes.

1098
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:53,240
This means that our Liege

1099
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,010
has at last had that intention.

1100
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:59,910
As expected, the person who has the highest chance
to become her bed partner is Matsushima-sama?

1101
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:01,350
That should be the case.

1102
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:09,150
Bow down...
for the entrance of our Liege!

1103
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:25,170
Raise your head.

1104
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,600
Yes.

1105
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:45,350
It is very fine that everyone is dressed
in the same black attire.

1106
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:49,470
The reason why I have you all
gather here today...

1107
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,930
is nothing else...

1108
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:54,330
but to dismiss you from service.

1109
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:00,540
You are to be dismissed...

1110
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:03,880
and to depart the Ooku within today.

1111
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,020
The Shogunate's budget...

1112
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,590
is being cut down more than
it has ever been before.

1113
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:16,160
It is thus inevitable...

1114
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:18,960
that the number of courtiers
in the Ooku be reduced.

1115
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:24,670
If young and handsome men like you all

1116
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:26,170
could leave this place,

1117
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:28,870
you would all be able
to find good prospects of marriage.

1118
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,810
It is not so easy for those
who are no as blessed as you are.

1119
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:37,280
That is why I have decided to keep in service...

1120
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:40,750
those who are not as likely to have prospects
of marrying a good match.

1121
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:44,120
Everyone,

1122
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:48,890
May you find good homes
while still in the springtime of your youth.

1123
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:52,000
And may you find happiness
in your own birthplace.

1124
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:59,400
That is my most sincere wish.

1125
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:05,510
That is all.

1126
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:18,990
This is my loss.

1127
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,000
You have defeated us,

1128
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:31,040
Lord Yoshimune...

1129
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:52,620
Well then,

1130
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:56,530
from now onwards,
how shall I revive this country...

1131
01:51:56,531 --> 01:52:01,531
