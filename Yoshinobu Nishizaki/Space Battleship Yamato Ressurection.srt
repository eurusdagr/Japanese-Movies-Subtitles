1
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,869
The infinite expanse ofthe universe...

2
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:50,369
A place filled with silence and light...

3
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:58,171
Our Solar System is about
30,OOO light years away

4
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:02,436
from the Galactic Center.

5
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,900
Earth.

6
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:32,069
The planet that, like a mother,
gave birth to us and raised us.

7
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,335
At the center ofthe Milky Way,

8
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,704
there is a space-time void with a mass
two million times that of our sun:

9
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,436
a black hole.

10
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,201
A black hole...

11
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:52,336
A pitch-black hole whose grasp not even
the slightest ray of light can escape.

12
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:57,538
The density in the deepest parts ofthat
hole makes it so gravity is infinite.

13
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,234
At the beginning of the 21st century,

14
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,834
Professor Hawking
suggested the possibility

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,005
that the radiation emitted by
these bodies during vaporization

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,205
contains information about the
matter that was sucked in.

17
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:28,136
Even in the 23rd century,

18
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:32,770
black holes remain a phenomenon
unfathomable to mankind.

19
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:37,003
Thus, humanity is still not aware that black holes are
the true rulers ofthe space-time continuum.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,173
No one has yet realized that
they are sentient life forms.

21
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:51,003
Like a young lion approaching
humans in the savanna,

22
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:54,235
feigning curiosity at first,

23
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:58,370
and then reacting in a
completely di_erent way...

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,103
Earth was suddenly faced
with a black hole.

25
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,401
Space Battleship Yamato.

26
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:11,003
17 years have passed since it sunk into the seas of
the migrating planet Aquarius.

27
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,869
lt is the year 2220 AD.

28
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,670
On Earth, mankind is confronted with an unprecedented
crisis:

29
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,838
a dark stellar body with a gravity so enormous not a
single ray of light can escape,

30
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,334
a black hole.

31
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:33,606
Every second, the black hole, hailing from a distant
corner ofthe galaxy, gets closer to Earth.

32
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:51,367
Gravitational signatures
detected at 12 o'clock!

33
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,868
Distance: approximately 25 space km!

34
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,034
What are those?

35
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,968
l have never seen ships like that before.

36
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,567
How many ships are there?

37
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:21,235
We have detected about
900 and counting.

38
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,201
900?!

39
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,134
At 2 o'clock!

40
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:27,603
Another unidentified fleet at 9:48!

41
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,567
We're being surrounded.

42
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,401
Captain, this is an ambush!

43
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,400
Hailing all ships!

44
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,235
Mark all unidentified vessels as hostile!

45
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,234
Kamijou, fire!

46
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,535
Fire! Fire! And fire again!

47
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,701
Those bastards...

48
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,600
Eat this!

49
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,935
All fighters, engage the enemy!

50
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,768
Protect the emigrant ships!

51
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,701
We're losing pressure quickly!

52
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,568
Disengage from the battlefield.

53
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,066
Warp!

54
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,733
Captain Kodai!

55
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,368
forfreighter Yuki.

56
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:50,533
Yes.

57
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,667
Here you go.

58
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:56,600
Captain!

59
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,836
lt took three months to arrive...

60
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,767
Thanks.

61
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,834
ls it from your wife again?

62
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,901
l really envy you.

63
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,803
Hello dear, how is the sea?

64
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:19,336
''The universe is a sea, and
the freighter is my ship. ''

65
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,402
lsn't that what you always said?

66
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:28,737
Miyuki and l are eagerly
awaiting your safe return.

67
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,234
Shipwreck detected!

68
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,833
Where's that shipwreck?

69
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,770
According to the map, it's 150
space km away at 4 o'clock.

70
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,935
We'll rescue the survivors.

71
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,001
Engine at full power!

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,302
Going full power with
this shabby engine...

73
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,867
this has got to be a joke!

74
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,901
Shut up and do it!

75
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,434
How long have you been on this ship?!

76
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,233
R-Right.

77
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,767
Full powerforward!

78
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,134
This is awful.

79
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,368
Look for survivors.

80
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,667
A survivor?

81
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,200
Looks like the barrier isn't broken.

82
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,934
Help him.

83
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,567
Damn!

84
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:43,434
You will pay for this!

85
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:43,966
Wait!

86
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:44,466
We're allies!

87
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:45,800
Allies?

88
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,067
H-Hey!

89
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,600
Emigrant ships from Earth?

90
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,701
Right.

91
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,338
l was part of an escort fleet
transporting 300 million people to Amarl.

92
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,401
300 million people?!

93
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,701
Were you attacked by them?

94
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,101
Y-Yes!

95
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,533
Damn!

96
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,567
Move!

97
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:11,035
All right, she can still fly.

98
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,168
Sakurai, locate the enemy's position.

99
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:13,500
Roger.

100
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,234
Damn them...

101
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:16,800
Wait!

102
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,867
Don't shoot yet!

103
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:19,800
Here they come.

104
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,834
Grab on to something!

105
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,767
What's your name?

106
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:37,270
Earth Defense Force 1st Lieutenant
and Tactical Oflicer Kamijou Ryo.

107
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:40,435
Kamijou, prepare the main battery!

108
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,734
Preparing main battery.

109
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,334
D-Distance: 3000!

110
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,967
C-Captain! We're going to collide!

111
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,467
Keep your cool, Sakurai!

112
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:58,500
We're going to crash!

113
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,566
Full throttle!

114
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,000
Now! Fire!

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,468
Firing main battey!

116
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:31,266
We did it!

117
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,068
Well done, Kamijou.

118
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:34,800
You've got some skill.

119
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,234
That's Captain Kodai for you!

120
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,001
Well done.

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,768
Captain Kodai...

122
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,568
The legenday captain of the Yamato...

123
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,601
We'll head back to Earth immediately.

124
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,034
Mayday! Mayday!

125
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,000
Who the hell are they?

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,534
Why are they attacking us?!

127
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:52,100
Here they come!

128
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,501
H-Help us!

129
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,234
When did this happen?

130
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,102
lt has been sent through the
booster relays a few times.

131
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,801
The footage is three days old.

132
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,135
Why were they attacked?

133
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,168
This is a massacre!

134
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,801
Who's the enemy?

135
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,168
We don't know.

136
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,467
Chief.

137
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,301
Shouldn't we postpone the departure

138
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:20,570
of the Third Emigration Fleet until
we know more about the situation?

139
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:25,070
We can't send transpoR ships there
knowing they will be destroyed!

140
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,735
Continue as planned.

141
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,667
With all due respect...

142
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,268
Has Kodai returned yet?

143
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:34,933
Kodai-san?

144
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:41,804
He's the only one who can save
the Earth from this danger.

145
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:44,702
We don't have much time.

146
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,969
Chief, we've been contacted by the Solar System
Communication Bureau.

147
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,200
Displaying transmission on screen B.

148
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,900
Okay.

149
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,101
This is the Solar System
Communication Bureau.

150
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,603
Deep space cargo vesseI Yuki wIl be be warping
out within the system.

151
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,667
Kodai...

152
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,867
You've come back...

153
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,834
Excuse me, Captain.

154
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,901
We're ready to warp out.

155
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,368
Okay, l'll be right there.

156
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,901
lt's been three years, huh.

157
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,802
l bet your daughter has
grown up into a fine lady.

158
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:33,967
Yeah.

159
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,268
We're finishing our lastjump.

160
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:42,500
We've finally returned to Earth!

161
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:07,901
Aquarius.

162
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:50,871
This observation footage has been colored, processed
and fast-forwarded

163
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,568
to make it easy to understand.

164
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,601
l hadn't expected this...

165
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:59,570
This is a black hole that doesn't move according to
any pattern we've observed.

166
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:04,504
We're calling it the
''Cascading Black Hole. ''

167
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,301
Yes, sir.

168
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,570
Are we certain it will devourthe Earth?

169
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,334
Yes.

170
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,535
We have run the
calculations over and over.

171
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:23,236
We are certain that it's passing
through the Solar System.

172
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,701
lt's unavoidable.

173
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,971
We estimate eight million seconds
before it reaches Earth.

174
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:35,270
ln other words, Earth has just three
months left until its destruction.

175
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,534
Yes.

176
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:41,103
We first observed this black
hole three years ago.

177
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,836
We gathered astronomers
from all around the world,

178
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,435
and organized daily conferences
to discuss countermeasures.

179
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:52,270
Altering the black hole's
trajectoy, destroying it...

180
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,635
terraforming one of the frontier planets

181
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,834
and temporarily taking shelterthere...

182
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,270
They even looked into
shifting the Earth's orbit.

183
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,801
Eventually, they came to the conclusion

184
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:07,537
that none of these possibilities were
feasible with our current technology.

185
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,270
Mankind's only hope is to seek
refuge in the vastness ofspace.

186
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:16,236
l've put Shima-kun in charge
ofthe emigration plans,

187
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,637
and finalized the preparations forthe evacuation of mankind
while helping them understand this decision.

188
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:25,437
l've heard that the crew ofthe salvaged ship was
escorting people to Amarl.

189
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,734
lndeed.

190
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,235
Amarl is located in the Sairam System.

191
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,136
Our destination is its moon.

192
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,235
Will we be able to
create a second Earth?

193
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:41,303
This is the route ofthe
Second Emigration Fleet.

194
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,834
Displaying map on screen C.

195
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,468
Any intel on the fleet that attacked us?

196
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,535
No, we have no intel on them yet.

197
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:02,436
Will the Earth vanish...

198
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,701
without leaving behind a trace?

199
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,269
This planet that the
Yamato has protected...

200
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,333
lndeed.

201
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,668
That's why l've been waiting for you.

202
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,500
For me?

203
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:19,538
l want you to take command ofthe Third Emigration
Fleet escort forces.

204
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,736
You're the only one
who can save mankind.

205
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,301
You're giving me too
much credit, Sanada-san.

206
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:32,170
l deserted the Earth and roamed
aimlessly for three years.

207
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,901
l'm not the man l used to be.

208
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:42,305
However, Yuki knew that you'd take
responsibility in this crisis

209
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,638
and assumed command o1the
First Emigration Fleet.

210
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,134
Miyuki...

211
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,303
Does she know about the
First Emigration Fleet?

212
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,602
''Dear, how is space?

213
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,335
The universe is your sea, isn't it?''

214
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,701
So you've returned...

215
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,768
Welcome back, Miyuki.

216
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,500
Your motherEUR''

217
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,167
lt's your fault, Father.

218
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,067
Th-That's not true.

219
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,768
You're way too attached to the Yamato.

220
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:24,303
The Yamato has already
sunk, don't you get it?

221
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,734
lt's resting in the depths ofthat sea.

222
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,167
Yes.

223
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,802
Mom just pretended to understand.

224
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,536
ln truth, she was so lonely.

225
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:43,838
ln my memories, her smile was
always veiled by loneliness.

226
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,001
l wantto see mom.

227
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:55,903
Miyuki, l haven't given up on her!

228
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,334
Kodai here.

229
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,300
We have an emergency!

230
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,469
The Second Emigration Fleet has been attacked by
an unknown armada.

231
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,801
We've lost contact with them!

232
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,200
Understood.

233
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,134
l'll be right there.

234
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,000
Just go.

235
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,567
l'm sorry.

236
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,735
So the Second Fleet was
annihilated as well...

237
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:59,171
Both the First and Second fleet
were attacked in the same vicinity,

238
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,167
a region about 17,OOO light
years away from Earth.

239
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:04,702
lt's as ifthey were ambushed.

240
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,436
There's one more thing bothering me.

241
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,903
The enemy fleet was diflerent
from the one l've encountered.

242
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,768
Theirform is too di_erent.

243
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,834
l fear it's a fleet from another planet.

244
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:20,703
Does that mean that several parties
are attacking Terran fleets?

245
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,704
lt looks like someone is trying
to prevent the emigration.

246
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:45,870
Please allow me to command
the Third Emigration Fleet.

247
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,168
Thanks, Kodai.

248
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:53,902
ForYuki, for mankind...

249
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,202
Your ship is ready foryou.

250
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,201
lt's the Space Battleship Yamato.

251
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,133
The Yamato?!

252
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:11,604
Space Battleship Yamato
is awaiting your return.

253
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,335
Aquarius.

254
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,967
17 years ago...

255
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:27,904
the migrating planet Aquarius
threatened to flood the Earth.

256
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,234
Kodai, Yuki.

257
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,101
You two will have a wonde_ul child.

258
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,636
Since it will be your child, l'm
sure itwill be really adorable.

259
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,070
l'll think of it as my grandchild.

260
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,900
Mother Earth...

261
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,702
Take care ofthese kids.

262
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,367
Yamato...

263
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:32,737
You have lought and
perished for this planet.

264
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:35,836
Let's go to where the soldiers rest.

265
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,534
Fire!

266
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Yamato.

267
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,534
Yes.

268
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:20,271
This is the new Space
Battleship Yamato, Kodai.

269
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,537
Yuki, l don't believe that you died.

270
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,269
No matter where you are, be
it the depths of Hell...

271
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,134
l'll come and save you.

272
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:03,133
Waitfor me!

273
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:07,503
However, l have to save humanity first.

274
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,168
Hey!

275
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,502
Don't touch the Yamato, old man!

276
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,467
Who are you?

277
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,902
You're a spy, aren't you?

278
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,268
Fight me!

279
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,033
Wait! lEUR''

280
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,434
No excuses!

281
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,767
That idiot!

282
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,035
Not bad!

283
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,101
YouEUR''

284
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,167
What are you doing, Kobayashi?!

285
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,501
Captain Kodai!

286
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,601
Captain?

287
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,636
Captain, l was an engineer on
the Yamato. Tokugawa Tasuke.

288
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,067
lt's been a long time, Tokugawa.

289
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:57,439
Currently, l'm in command ofthe Earth Defense
Force Moonbase Yamato Reconstruction Project.

290
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:59,934
You're in charge of
rebuilding the Yamato?

291
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:00,600
Yes.

292
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,400
Hey wait!

293
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,767
Hey! Hold on!

294
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,636
We're the ones that rebuilt
the Yamato's engine room.

295
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,133
l see.

296
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,034
That sounds reassuring.

297
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:11,734
Would you tell me your names?

298
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,035
Tenma Sou from engineering.

299
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,334
Likewise, Shou.

300
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,233
And you?

301
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:22,435
Earth Defense Force
pilot, Kobayashi Jun.

302
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,069
Though he's lacking in
military discipline...

303
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,234
D-Don't laugh!

304
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:33,268
So this is the new wave-motion engine...

305
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:37,403
The old Yamato had one
nuclear reactorwave core.

306
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,436
On the other hand, the new Yamato has six big nuclear
reactor wave cores.

307
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:41,634
Six?

308
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,301
Then the wave-motion cannon can...

309
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:45,801
Yes, it can fire six rounds.

310
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,100
That's amazing.

311
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,535
That's quite a power-up.

312
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:53,467
Ob...

313
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:54,300
... viously!

314
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,402
Check this super charger!

315
00:27:56,366 --> 00:28:01,304
The six consecutive transition wave-motion cannon
rounds can even blow the moon into smithereens!

316
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,338
But ifwe were to use all six rounds,
the engine would be depleted.

317
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,834
l see.

318
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,535
So we mustn'tfire all the rounds.

319
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:13,202
Which means it has to be
maintained pe_ectly.

320
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,366
Of...

321
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:15,233
... course!

322
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,003
So, Sakurai, how is the
Yamato's computer room?

323
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,234
Captain!

324
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:31,401
This is unreal! As
expected from the Yamato.

325
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,168
l've been pumped up with excitement!

326
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:37,302
l trust you to make full use
ofthe ECl's potential.

327
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:37,633
Yes, sir!

328
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:42,870
You're the only crew member that has experienced
a voyage to Amarl.

329
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:45,035
l have high hopes for
you as a piler as well.

330
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,234
Yes, sir!

331
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:49,736
l've only gone there as practice, but
l'll live up to your expectation.

332
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,267
Maho-san, this is the Captain.

333
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:52,434
Captain?

334
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,404
l am the ECl Chief
Navigator, Orihara Maho.

335
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:02,435
l think we've met at the
Astro Science Department.

336
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes.

337
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,569
So you were that Orihara.

338
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:10,337
You're being called the Child of
the ECl, the genius navigator.

339
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:13,001
Oh my, genius?

340
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,067
You're exaggerating.

341
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,801
Your task is very important.

342
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:19,535
l'm counting on your
assistance with Sakurai-kun.

343
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,867
Yes, Captain!

344
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,001
We're about to depart.

345
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,968
Everyone, run your systems checks.

346
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,100
Yes, sir.

347
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:36,235
Departure, huh...

348
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,835
All this nervousness
has made me hungry.

349
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:43,303
Every time you open your mouth it's to say you're
hungry. Isn't it, Nakanishi-kun?

350
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,901
Will you be able to fire?

351
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,367
What?

352
00:29:55,733 --> 00:30:00,838
l'm wondering ifwe should really leave the wave-motion
cannon to a loser.

353
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,233
Say that again...

354
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:04,400
Stop it, Kobayashi!

355
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:07,668
This is the Yamato we
brought back to Jife.

356
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:11,670
l don't want itto sink.

357
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:13,933
You...

358
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,034
Stop it!

359
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,334
Stop!

360
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:23,569
Aren't you Kobayashi, the chief pilot?

361
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:26,535
And you are Kamijou, the
tactical o_icer, right?

362
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,533
Who are you?

363
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:30,401
l'm Oomura Kousaku, the
executive oflicer.

364
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,869
l don't care ifyou're the XO or the CEO.

365
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:37,803
lt's me and the Tenma brothers who brought the Yamato
back to life!

366
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,567
l don't want to see it getting wrecked!

367
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,667
lnsubordinate brat!

368
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:46,637
The rebirth ofthe Yamato was only possible because
all of mankind wished for it!

369
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,634
C-Captain.

370
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:01,433
Gentlemen.

371
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:05,603
l'm the Captain of the
Yamato, Kodai Susumu.

372
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,969
Your lives are in my hands now.

373
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:12,069
We will protect humanity and
the Earth with the Yamato!

374
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,368
How do you feel?

375
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:31,866
Great!

376
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,204
The Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Escort Fleets are
Iaunching from Moonbase.

377
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,302
They're going to rendezvous with
the Third Emigration Fleet.

378
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,835
They're currently awaiting
orders in lunar orbit.

379
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,201
All ships, prepare for departure.

380
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,700
A_irmative.

381
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,701
lnitiating wave engine.

382
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,303
Moving to the ECl to
finalize preparations.

383
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:34,534
All systems functional.

384
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,034
Engine room, all systems ready.

385
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,368
Engine room is ready.

386
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:49,301
All communication lines are open.

387
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,201
All transfers functional.

388
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,835
All radars functional.

389
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,169
Firing systems are functional.

390
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,935
lnternal systems, all green.

391
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,067
No anomalies detected.

392
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,701
Navigation systems functional.

393
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:04,869
Launching preparations are done.

394
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:06,967
Undocking.

395
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,735
Activate the auxiliary engine.

396
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,435
Linking auxiliary engine to power nexus.

397
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,535
Switching on the power nexus.

398
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,671
Enable the first and second
flywheel in ten seconds.

399
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,701
First flywheel connected!

400
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,835
Second flywheel connected!

401
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:43,766
Yeah!

402
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,368
Releasing the gantry lock.

403
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,701
Yamato, take ofl!

404
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:06,539
Farewell, Mother Earth. It's
time for this ship to depart.

405
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:15,475
Space Battleship Yamato,

406
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:18,669
fly to the other side of
the universe, to Iscandar.

407
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:23,237
Shoulder your destiny and take ofl now.

408
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,873
l'm sure you will come back here

409
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:37,607
and answer the people that
wave to you with a smile.

410
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,036
Leave the galaxy and go all the way

411
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:52,309
to Iscandar, Space Battleship Yamato.

412
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,735
We're counting on you, Yamato.

413
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,935
Take care of it, Kodai.

414
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:13,036
Kobayashi, that was a great maneuver.

415
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:14,900
Of course!

416
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,471
The Solar System, where the Earth is located, is
positioned in the Orion Spur.

417
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:54,301
lt's about 30,OOO light
years away from the center.

418
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,902
We're currently observing this part.

419
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,434
lt's approaching from this angle.

420
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,369
l think it's going to suck in the
Solar System as it passes through.

421
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,501
The destination ofthe emigrant fleet is

422
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,568
the planet Amarl in the Sairam System.

423
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:10,569
lt's 27,OOO light years away
from the Galactic Center.

424
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:16,204
The emigration lleet will reach its
destination after warping several times.

425
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,372
However, the First and Second Emigration Fleets were
attacked by an unknown armada

426
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:27,970
about halfway into their voyage in
this region 17,OOO light years away,

427
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:29,367
and were annihilated.

428
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,137
ln otherwords, the Yamato's mission is not only to
escort the Third Emigration Fleet safely there,

429
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,103
but, also, to bring the
ships back to Earth.

430
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,269
Before the Earth is swallowed
by the Cascading Black Hole...

431
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:50,369
After all the emigrant
ships have been prepped,

432
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,368
we will make the first warp jump.

433
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,333
Dismissed.

434
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,667
Dr. Sasaki.

435
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:02,402
l've been pondering about
this for a while now.

436
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,368
Why do you have goggles?

437
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:07,902
Oh? You didn't know?

438
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,203
l don't quite look the part,
but l'm actually a pilot.

439
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,967
You're a pilot?

440
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,534
Oh and...

441
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,068
''Doctor'' sounds too formal.

442
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:19,134
l'm just not used to it.

443
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:20,868
You can call me Miharu.

444
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,535
First and second engines, ignite.

445
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:32,367
Understood.

446
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:34,401
lgniting first and second engines.

447
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,701
Yamato, enter warp.

448
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:58,070
The Third Emigration
Fleet and the Yamato,

449
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:02,170
consumed by the fear that the unknown enemy fleet
could strike at any time,

450
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,968
continued theirjourney to Amarl.

451
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:07,201
But at that time...

452
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:12,869
Attention leaders o1 the
Interstellar Alliance...

453
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:18,037
The president o1the Alliance, SUS representative
Governor-General Metzler, has arrived.

454
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,068
A big threat, a galactic evil...

455
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,935
Earth has made its move.

456
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,167
Behold.

457
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:41,403
So Earth finally made their move.

458
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,568
They have really started their invasion.

459
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:54,004
We cannot turn a blind eye while
Earth jeopardizes our peace.

460
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,905
On behalfofthe Alliance, l hereby command the
annihilation of the Terran fleet.

461
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:05,871
Unless the Earth is destroyed,
our Alliance cannot prosper.

462
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:15,004
Admiral, we have received a message from the
Interstellar Alliance through the Ethos brass.

463
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,400
Report.

464
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:21,301
A gigantic fleet has departed the Earth.

465
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:24,269
Attack and destroy upon sight.

466
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:32,569
Currently, we are 17,OOO
light years away from Earth.

467
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,801
Eveything has gone smoothly so far.

468
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:37,101
Orihara, deploy the probes.

469
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:38,000
Roger.

470
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:40,834
Launching the probes.

471
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,867
What the hell is this?

472
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:56,101
Maho-san, what is that?

473
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:00,868
lt's a honeycomb-type search network.

474
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,535
They could be observing our movements.

475
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,005
l assume the First and Second Emigration Fleets
were caught by this network.

476
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:12,035
That's very likely, since
they were ambushed.

477
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:16,370
Maho, show me how far
the network extends.

478
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,901
Stafl, gather in the
central situation room.

479
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,802
How big is the network?

480
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,135
lt's impossible to get past it.

481
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,702
lf it were just the Yamato, we
could push our way through,

482
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,868
but it's impossible to take that
many emigrant vessels along.

483
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,703
Captain, why don't we make
a turning movement there?

484
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:38,803
We could make a long warp jump straight from
the emigrant fleet rendezvous point.

485
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,535
Even if it's feasible
with the Yamato's engine,

486
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:45,002
their ship engines can't
possibly handle such a jump.

487
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:47,101
l think it could work.

488
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:53,205
There is a black hole called
BH-199 nearthe emigrant fleet.

489
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,635
We will go through that.

490
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,300
l'm putting it on the screen.

491
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:03,136
lt's gigantic... with a mass
300 times that ofthe Sun.

492
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,834
The gravity is enormous, too.

493
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:09,436
We'll accelerate while being pulled in...

494
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,436
By using that gravity pull,
we can make a flyby.

495
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:21,168
Don't be ridiculous!

496
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:24,102
Can you imagine what will
happen ifthe flyby goes wrong?

497
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,901
lfwe fail,

498
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,436
after passing the event horizon, we will be swallowed
by the black hole.

499
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:30,567
Right.

500
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:32,668
But it's still feasible!

501
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,534
Hey, academy brat.

502
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,438
There's no signboards
showing the event horizon.

503
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:42,869
Are you aware how many lives are
dependent on our decisions?

504
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:46,502
Even ifyou try to go back
in your own footsteps,

505
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:50,169
you will be long swallowed by
the black hole, academy brat.

506
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:53,468
What do you think, Oomura-san?

507
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:55,935
lt's definitely tricky.

508
00:41:55,933 --> 00:42:00,604
l have no prior experience in approaching black holes
with emigrant ships...

509
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,701
However...

510
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,602
There's no otherway, right?

511
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:12,500
Yes.

512
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,135
We'll pe_orm a flyby.

513
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,002
We cannot overcome this hurdle
ifwe're consumed by fear.

514
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:25,203
Orihara, collect data on BH-199.

515
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,202
Sakurai, apprise the fleet of our plans.

516
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:29,700
Yes, sir.

517
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,901
So they really came.

518
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,235
All vessels, prepare to engage.

519
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,101
Attention all ships,

520
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:13,203
we're pe_orming the last warp
jump to the Sairam System.

521
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,570
Take your positions and
warp out in order!

522
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:56,569
Just like that... carefully...

523
00:43:57,033 --> 00:44:00,403
Maintain speed at 99 space knots.

524
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:39,402
Speed: 120 space knots.

525
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,334
Roger.

526
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:43,268
l can't stand this anymore!

527
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:47,570
Please! Oh, please!

528
00:45:08,966 --> 00:45:10,867
The first group has warped out.

529
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:11,833
Thank the heavens.

530
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:12,567
All right!

531
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:13,867
lt's a great success!

532
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:16,535
The second group is about to warp.

533
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:24,602
What a fearless warp.

534
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,068
We can'tjust sit here slack-jawed.

535
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:29,768
Their commander seems to
be an interesting person.

536
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:32,434
We cannot allow them to slip away.

537
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,034
All vessels, attack!

538
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:41,235
Captain, the enemy fleet has appeared.

539
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:43,168
Direction: 4:23.

540
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,734
Distance: 2, 8 space km.

541
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:46,934
lt's them!

542
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:48,966
Don't panic!

543
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:50,267
We still have some time.

544
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:54,102
Let the emigration fleet
continue warping out.

545
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:57,369
All escoR lorces disperse
and cover their backs.

546
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,403
Kobayashi, alter the course to 4:23.

547
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:05,633
Roger.

548
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,902
Altering the course to 4:23.

549
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:13,536
Kamijou, this battle is in your hands.

550
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:14,533
Understood.

551
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,634
All ships, prepare for battle.

552
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:17,600
Man your turrets.

553
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:21,168
All fighters, prepare to sortie.

554
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:53,769
Kobayashi, turn the Yamato to the
ridge ofthe emigration fleet.

555
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,333
Understood.

556
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,701
Just watch!

557
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:57,867
l'll crush you all!

558
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,936
Another enemy fleet
has appeared at 3:30.

559
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,703
Anotherfleet has appeared at 1:20.

560
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:39,567
Attention escort fleet,

561
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,734
Split in two!

562
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:43,769
One halfwill take the port side fleet, the other half the
starboard side.

563
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,169
The Yamato will engage
the enemy in the middle!

564
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,734
All fighters, launch!

565
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,066
l'll go too!

566
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:51,200
The more the better!

567
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,069
But you're the one steering the Yamato...

568
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:55,367
l'll do it.

569
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:59,702
He's better suited to fly a fighter.

570
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:02,402
The greater our force is the better our chance to protect
the emigration fleet.

571
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,904
Kobayashi, take command of
the Cosmo Pulser Squad.

572
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:09,733
Thanks!

573
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:10,767
Understood!

574
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,601
Hey, Maho!

575
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:14,800
lt's me, Kobayashi.

576
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,902
l'll protect you from the outside.

577
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,136
Hey Miharu, wanna go on
a space date with me?

578
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,401
Don't be silly.

579
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,568
Kobayashi, l heard that weird confession.

580
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:34,901
That was no confession.

581
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:36,901
Doctor! What are you doing?

582
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,700
You can't go out.

583
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:38,666
Hush!

584
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,002
l got on the Yamato because
l like this stu_.

585
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,568
But what ifwe have casualties?

586
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:46,734
You can do the first aid.

587
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:07,870
Kobayashi, l'll shoot you
down ifyou screw up!

588
00:49:07,866 --> 00:49:09,067
All right!

589
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:11,201
l'd be okay with it if l
were shot down by you.

590
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:40,035
Cosmo Pulser Squadron, follow me!

591
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:08,867
Full speed ahead!

592
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:10,867
Prepare the main battery!

593
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,034
All vessels, open fire!

594
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,635
Kobayashi, several fighters are being launched from the
vessels in the center!

595
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:42,433
Take care ofthem!

596
00:50:42,433 --> 00:50:43,500
Roger!

597
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,701
All units, altitude: 9000.

598
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:45,300
Follow me!

599
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:21,333
Miharu, behind you!

600
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,134
Nice one, Miharu.

601
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,134
l'll hug you when we get back.

602
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:47,200
Jerk.

603
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:53,068
Shift all muzzles to the left!

604
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,968
Prepare the stack missiles!

605
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:57,401
Distance: 30 space km.

606
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,735
Firing angle: 45oard.

607
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:02,466
Fire!

608
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:23,968
Aim for that big ship!

609
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:24,767
Roger.

610
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,436
An enemy group is approaching the emigrant vessels
from the port at 4:30.

611
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,535
Distance: 18 space km.

612
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,235
Kamijou, deploy the heavy bomber.

613
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:44,067
Yes, sir!

614
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:00,703
Heavy bomber, attack the hostile at 4:30 port of
the emigrant vessels.

615
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:01,400
Roger!

616
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:01,966
Now!

617
00:54:01,966 --> 00:54:02,866
Fire!

618
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:03,833
Yes, sir.

619
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:06,435
Prepare first and second batteries.

620
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:09,133
Fire!

621
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:12,935
Launch bow torpedoes!

622
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:26,334
What are they doing?

623
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,335
lt's that ship...

624
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:36,639
That ship is encouraging the whole
fleet and increasing their power.

625
00:54:36,633 --> 00:54:38,768
That ship?

626
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:40,334
Aim for that ship.

627
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,134
Forget about the others.

628
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:44,635
Blow that ship to smithereens!

629
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,967
Yes, sir!

630
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:56,900
Damn that Gorui...

631
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:59,835
Having trouble against a fleet like that.

632
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,001
He's not worth my attention.

633
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:08,236
Escort ships Hatsuyuki
and Shirayuki are down.

634
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:09,834
Explosions in the Asagiri.

635
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,403
The enemy is moving
toward the black hole.

636
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,169
How far along are the emigrant vessels?

637
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,801
880/o ofthem have warped.

638
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:24,870
Attention all escoR ships,
pull back as you fight,

639
00:55:24,866 --> 00:55:27,602
and prepare to warp after
the emigration fleet.

640
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:29,467
The Yamato will take
care ofthe enemy fleet!

641
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:38,603
All fighters, help the
escort force to withdraw!

642
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:53,233
Damn!

643
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:55,568
l'll kill them for sure!

644
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:58,902
Prepare the wave-motion cannon!

645
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,201
Don't get carried away, Kamijou!

646
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:06,336
lt's pointless to use the wave-motion
cannon against a scattered fleet!

647
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,868
Not only is it ine_ective,

648
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:12,569
but it will cost the Yamato
the energy it needs to warp.

649
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:15,834
l'm sorry.

650
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,469
This fleet is completely di_erent from the one we
defeated the other day.

651
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:48,600
lt's because ofthat ship.

652
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,172
Such a sublime decision... not to
Iose even a single emigrant vessel.

653
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:58,636
Their spirit is what makes their command ofthe
whole fleet so extraordinay.

654
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:02,136
You seem to admire the enemy.

655
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,804
ls this really the way an invader fights?

656
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,905
l feel a strong will to live,
rather than to invade.

657
00:57:13,866 --> 00:57:17,102
What we are doing is no
di_erent than a massacre.

658
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:21,436
That ship on the other hand...

659
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,334
Rapid turn!

660
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,701
Captain! What are you doing?

661
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:42,136
Kamijou, shoot randomly at that ship!

662
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:42,900
Yes, sir!

663
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:05,634
Cease the attack!

664
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:07,833
Why?

665
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:13,104
Don't you think that it would be
regrettable to bury that enemy?

666
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,734
lndeed.

667
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:19,604
lt's frantically trying to protect the emigrant vessels by
risking its own life.

668
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:25,137
We used to have that soldierly spirit.

669
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:26,734
But look at us now...

670
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:32,072
Now we are bound to that parvenu SUS
and helping to massacre people.

671
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:35,402
Don't you think we should stop
degrading ourselves any further?

672
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:38,735
lt's something only you'd say, Admiral.

673
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,602
Cease the attack, Captain.

674
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:43,567
Understood, sir.

675
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:47,669
Attention Ethos fleet, cease fire!

676
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:52,568
Full speed ahead!

677
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:55,901
Where are we going?

678
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,769
We must regain our honor.

679
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,201
Enemy fire has stopped.

680
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:17,400
What?

681
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:19,068
All fighters, hury up!

682
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,069
Captain, there's an incoming
transmission from that ship.

683
00:59:32,466 --> 00:59:33,200
What?

684
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:34,367
Put it on the panel.

685
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:42,738
l'm the Commander in Chief o1 Planet
Ethos's fleet, Admiral Gorui.

686
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:46,169
l highly admire your
eflort on the battlefield.

687
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,004
Would you tell me the name
of the captain and his ship?

688
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:55,003
EaRh Defense Force Space
Battleship Yamato.

689
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,568
l'm the Captain, Kodai Susumu.

690
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,703
Space Battleship
Yamato... Captain Kodai.

691
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:04,135
l'll be frank now.

692
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:06,769
The Ethos military has
many excellent allies,

693
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:10,102
and it also respects formidable enemies.

694
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:11,367
This is an old tradition.

695
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,634
lf l cannot protect this honor,

696
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,703
l'd chose an honorable
death like the Yamato.

697
01:00:17,433 --> 01:00:19,034
l'd like to ask you, Admiral Gorei.

698
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,868
Why are you attacking us?

699
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,303
lt's decision of the Greater
Urup InterstellarAlliance.

700
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:30,169
The leadership ofthe union
has been grabbed by the SUS.

701
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:32,534
The SUS...

702
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:38,705
But this massacre is nothing but an irrational
way of demonstrating their power.

703
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:45,139
Therefore, l deeply respect your e_orts ofsaving
the emigration fleet from them.

704
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:51,069
l appreciate that, Admiral Gorui.

705
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:54,068
Good luck.

706
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:26,603
What's the meaning ofthis, Gorui?

707
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,437
l'm only following the
Ethos military honor code.

708
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:37,806
Does the honor code ofthe Ethos military state to defy the
decision ofthe Greater Urup InterstellarAlliance?

709
01:01:37,766 --> 01:01:43,004
lsn't that the will of the SUS,
rather than that ofthe Alliance?

710
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:49,004
l assume you know the
consequences ofdefying us.

711
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,635
Oh, what are you going to do?

712
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,303
lfyou ever defy my orders again,

713
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,437
l'll not only destroy you,
but your whole planet!

714
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:03,734
Keep that in mind.

715
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,368
Destroy Ethos?

716
01:02:10,366 --> 01:02:15,437
No matter what happens, our
citizens will understand.

717
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,968
Attention all emigrant vessels.

718
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:25,801
We're about to arrive at Amarl.

719
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:27,000
Finalize your preparations.

720
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,635
Kobayashi, you can switch back now.

721
01:02:30,633 --> 01:02:31,433
Yes, sir.

722
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:17,267
lt's the Yamato!

723
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:19,034
The Yamato has come!

724
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:19,900
lndeed.

725
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,101
Wow!

726
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:52,203
Thank heavens this emigration
fleet made it safely here.

727
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:02,868
Looks like the emigrants
are doing fine here.

728
01:04:02,866 --> 01:04:03,199
Yes.

729
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:06,068
There's something l'd like to ask.

730
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:11,805
ls the First Emigration Fleet's
Ieader, Kodai Yuki, here?

731
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:15,035
l'm afraid she's missing.

732
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:20,104
Actually, my current duties were supposed to
be handled by Commander Kodai.

733
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:27,271
We were busy trying to warp out and
escape underfierce enemy fire.

734
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:30,769
The ship she boarded warped
without a person on board.

735
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,067
Oh, where is it?

736
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:35,401
lt's this ship.

737
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,035
So you couldn't find her body...

738
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:01,433
Yes.

739
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:03,700
l see.

740
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,135
l will keep searching for her.

741
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:07,367
Thank you.

742
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:13,736
From now on, that moon will
become our Earth, huh?

743
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:19,003
l wonder i1the people of Amarl
will call it Earth as well?

744
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:22,033
Sorry.

745
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,369
Well, people would oppose me if
l were to call that moon Earth.

746
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,337
When l think that the
Earth cannot be saved...

747
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:33,667
We have to accept it.

748
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,535
Without that resolve,

749
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:41,403
it would mean that mankind
has merely run away from it.

750
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,667
Chief Sanada!

751
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:48,102
We have received a message
from Captain Kodai.

752
01:05:49,433 --> 01:05:52,202
We have landed on Amarl.

753
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:56,270
April 5th, 14:10 Earth time.

754
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:57,967
The situation is as follows:

755
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,069
6, 300 emigrant vessels,

756
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:03,969
162 escort ships.

757
01:06:03,966 --> 01:06:07,102
Furthermore, we've met up with the survivors of
the First and Second fleets.

758
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,635
This adds up to 630 million people.

759
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,101
After the maintenance works,

760
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:15,570
the Yamato will return with
the six emigrant vessels.

761
01:06:15,566 --> 01:06:16,400
Over.

762
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,467
He did it!

763
01:06:21,466 --> 01:06:22,934
Kodai-san lives up to his name.

764
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:24,600
Yeah.

765
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:27,068
Thanks Kodai.

766
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,701
l'm awaiting your quick return.

767
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,201
Hey, wait!

768
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:37,768
Your leg hasn't healed yet.

769
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,368
You have to be patient for a bit longer.

770
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,367
Miyuki-chan!

771
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,202
Hello, Dr. Sado.

772
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,536
Kodai and his crew have
safely landed on Amarl.

773
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:50,868
That's Kodai for you!

774
01:06:51,699 --> 01:06:55,937
Miyuki-chan, at times like these
just be honest and happy...

775
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:58,101
Dr. Sado...

776
01:06:58,066 --> 01:07:01,636
My father has the Yamato.

777
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:05,501
Miyuki-chan, do you know...

778
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,538
... do you know how many lives
he and your mom have saved?

779
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:12,567
Mother...

780
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:16,135
He couldn't save Mother!

781
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,335
lt's time to give it his milk.

782
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,469
Young kids are hard to understand.

783
01:07:26,466 --> 01:07:27,867
lndeed.

784
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:43,433
Your Majesty.

785
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:47,537
l've heard that Amarl is working
together with the Interstellar Alliance.

786
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:53,570
Long ago the center ofthe Milky
Way sufFered from great wars.

787
01:07:54,566 --> 01:07:59,437
Our country was sucked into
those wars, and was ruined.

788
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:02,402
That situation continued
over generations.

789
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:09,404
The first step toward peace
was under the mighty SUS.

790
01:08:10,266 --> 01:08:14,370
The flames of war stopped
upon SUS's call of peace.

791
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:18,770
And that gave birth to the
InterstellarAlliance.

792
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,237
So that's why the SUS is the
Ieader ofthe Alliance.

793
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,066
Yes.

794
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:32,206
But in truth it's merely a tyrannical dictatorship
under the guise of ''peace. ''

795
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:34,902
We ought to hate the SUS.

796
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:36,301
But...

797
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:36,867
But?

798
01:08:37,133 --> 01:08:41,337
We're supplying the SUS with resources.

799
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:43,067
Resources?

800
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:46,369
Yes, there's a material that
only exists on this planet.

801
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:51,437
And in return we are receiving
the SUS's protection.

802
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:55,737
Could you really call
this peace for Amarl?

803
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,467
Stop!

804
01:09:10,266 --> 01:09:12,301
l'm General Pascal.

805
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:13,200
Go in there.

806
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:24,038
Captain Kodai, l'd like to ask you
to leave our country at once.

807
01:09:24,033 --> 01:09:27,536
lf we accept Terrans,

808
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,669
we will be punished by the
InterstellarAlliance's forces.

809
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,769
ln the worst case, they
would destroy this planet.

810
01:09:33,766 --> 01:09:35,467
Please, leave this planet.

811
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:38,369
Are you saying that you'll bow
down to a cowardly tyrant?

812
01:09:38,366 --> 01:09:40,468
lt's to protect this country.

813
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:41,700
We don't have any time.

814
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,902
lfyou aren't going to
listen to our plea, then...

815
01:09:48,433 --> 01:09:49,500
We were too late!

816
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:54,568
l want you to stay out ofthis.

817
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:57,435
Please don't drive us further
into this predicament.

818
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:27,867
Forward!

819
01:10:38,899 --> 01:10:40,101
lt's them!

820
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,167
There's no mistake!

821
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:42,633
Them?

822
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,302
They attacked the First Fleet.

823
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:47,734
Sir, prepare to launch!

824
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:48,733
We'll get ready for the fight!

825
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:49,700
Wait!

826
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:52,636
How can you order us into combat
readinessjust like that?

827
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:55,068
Only the Captain can decide that.

828
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:57,801
They're withdrawing.

829
01:11:00,933 --> 01:11:04,503
l assume thatwasjust theirfirst wave.

830
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:10,267
Captain!

831
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,166
Give us the orderto sortie!

832
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:15,100
Captain!

833
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,969
What happened?

834
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:20,435
This is notjust our problem.

835
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:26,272
The SUS and Amarl are both members ofthe same
InterstellarAlliance after all.

836
01:11:26,266 --> 01:11:30,536
Our decision could greatly a_ect Amarl.

837
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:35,201
We cannot act carelessly.

838
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:37,500
No way. .

839
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:45,102
All hands, prepare for
engagement and stand by.

840
01:11:50,366 --> 01:11:53,001
Several enemy crafts on high
altitude above the city.

841
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,267
Crap!

842
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:55,567
This has to be the second wave.

843
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,367
Call Me_ler.

844
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:30,200
Yes sir.

845
01:12:32,866 --> 01:12:37,036
Commander Me_ler, why
are you attacking Amarl?

846
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:38,567
Aren't we allies?

847
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:45,171
They are being sanctioned for defying the Greater
Urup InterstellarAlliance's decision.

848
01:12:45,433 --> 01:12:51,305
l believe the InterstellarAlliance didn't tell us to murder
Amarl civilians as well.

849
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:52,966
Who decided that?!

850
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:54,834
lt's the SUS.

851
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,104
The SUS's decision is the decision
ofthe InterstellarAlliance.

852
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,137
Now, Gorui, commence
your attack already.

853
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,267
l refuse.

854
01:13:07,066 --> 01:13:08,567
Admiral...

855
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:14,705
Your unpleasant attitude from
yesterday has caught our attention.

856
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:19,538
l've just realized how you've
degraded to the level of a pig.

857
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:24,602
l'll keep those words in mind.

858
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:29,468
Looks like you've finally let it out.

859
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,336
Humans cannot choose
how they are born,

860
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,634
but they can choose how they die.

861
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:38,134
l want to die honorably!

862
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,201
lncoming transmission
from Admiral Gorui.

863
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,301
Okay, l'll get back to the bridge.

864
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,668
Captain Kodai.

865
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:08,933
Admiral.

866
01:14:08,899 --> 01:14:15,172
What we're doing is definitely not in order to protect
the people of Earth or Amarl.

867
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:20,669
lt's the decision ofthe people of Ethos.

868
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:24,903
We have been oppressed in
exchange for ''peace. ''

869
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:28,236
That's how the Interstellar
Alliance truly operates.

870
01:14:28,933 --> 01:14:32,002
We're hereby going to put an end to this!

871
01:14:58,133 --> 01:15:04,973
The day will come when they realize
how foolish their actions were.

872
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:08,869
Ourtarget is theflagship Maya,

873
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:10,368
Metzler!

874
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,467
Understood.

875
01:15:11,466 --> 01:15:12,834
Full powerforward!

876
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,634
That's...

877
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,001
Crush Gorui!

878
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,634
Damn that Gorui!

879
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:02,567
Pascal.

880
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:05,468
What do you think of Ethos's decision?

881
01:16:06,933 --> 01:16:08,000
Your Majesty!

882
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,736
The citizens have gathered in
front ofthe royal palace!

883
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,169
Their numbers are gradually increasing!

884
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:19,302
Make Amarl independent!

885
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:24,935
Let's fight along with the Yamato!

886
01:16:24,933 --> 01:16:26,134
Queen Ilya!

887
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,935
Declare our independence!

888
01:16:27,933 --> 01:16:30,468
Let's fight along with the Yamato!

889
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:33,302
Declare our independence!

890
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,903
What do you say about
their cries, Pascal?

891
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,001
Damn!

892
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,401
l want to kick their asses...

893
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:52,235
Why isn't the captain
giving the orderto fire?

894
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:59,506
Yuki, Amarl is walking the
path of peril for our Earth.

895
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,936
However, the Yamato can't do anything...

896
01:17:02,933 --> 01:17:06,236
lfwe retaliate, Amarl can be saved.

897
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:10,770
But then humanity will lose its
place to settle, and perish.

898
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:15,236
Your courage has always
protected the Earth.

899
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:17,801
lt saved humanity.

900
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,571
You never succumb to injustice, and
always hold up righteousness...

901
01:17:23,566 --> 01:17:25,267
Even if it means risking your own life.

902
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:30,237
l'm sure you're not the only
one who thinks that way.

903
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:34,770
The whole crew of Space Battleship Yamato must
share the same feelings.

904
01:17:40,633 --> 01:17:44,269
Oomura-san, send the emigration
fleet ahead to Earth.

905
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,136
Nakanishi, relay my message
to Queen Ilya ofAmarl.

906
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,934
Yes, sir.

907
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:56,571
Humankind will never succumb
to tyranny and oppression.

908
01:17:56,533 --> 01:17:59,235
Hereby, we declare war on
the InterstellarAlliance,

909
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:03,336
and in order to uphold justice, we are
ready to fight until the last man.

910
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:09,104
This might inconvenience
the Kingdom of Amarl.

911
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:09,567
However...

912
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,401
Captain Kodai.

913
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:16,370
We havejust arrived to
the same decision as you.

914
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,936
We have decided to fight the
InterstellarAlliance...

915
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:23,803
No, the SUS.

916
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,369
We declare our true independence,

917
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:29,435
and we will fight the
SUS until the last man.

918
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,969
Let's uphold justice together.

919
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,468
Attention all crew members,

920
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:42,902
the Yamato will abandon its mission
to escort the emigration fleet,

921
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:44,901
and engage the enemy fleet.

922
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:52,105
Our enemy is the dictatorship, the SUS, that governs
the West Star Systems, the Interstellar Alliance.

923
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,135
The Kingdom of Amarl has
declared its independence.

924
01:18:54,133 --> 01:18:56,702
And in order for mankind to survive,

925
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:59,135
we have no other choice
butto defeatthe SUS.

926
01:18:59,133 --> 01:19:04,404
This fight will decide
our and Amarl's future!

927
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,436
There are things we can only
protect by shedding blood.

928
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:10,469
Everyone, believe in what's
right and engage the enemy!

929
01:20:01,533 --> 01:20:06,738
Thank you Captain Kodai,
Space Battleship Yamato.

930
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,434
Yamato, lift ofF!

931
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:10,568
Yamato, lift ofF.

932
01:20:34,066 --> 01:20:37,602
l can't believe the InterstellarAlliance has experienced
such a bitter defeat!

933
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,501
This cannot happen!

934
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,035
Our enemy is the filthy Terrans!

935
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:44,402
This is the greatest humiliation
l've ever experienced!

936
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:47,469
ln the name of the Interstellar Alliance,

937
01:20:47,433 --> 01:20:50,736
we will send the Yamato to Hell!

938
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:08,135
Captain, we've received a call
from the ship that's following us.

939
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:14,634
General Pascal!

940
01:21:15,033 --> 01:21:20,972
Captain Kodai, please allow us
to take part in the battle.

941
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,101
You're back.

942
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,970
The Terran and Amarl
fleets are approaching.

943
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:42,369
Reinforcements from Fride and
Beldel have already arrived.

944
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,335
There's no reason to panic!

945
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,368
We will focus our attacks
on the stronghold.

946
01:22:06,366 --> 01:22:08,668
All hands, prepare for battle.

947
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:12,101
All hands, prepare for battle.

948
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,070
Cosmo Pulser Squad, heavy
bombers, prepare fortake-o_.

949
01:22:16,066 --> 01:22:19,102
Kobayashi, take charge o1
the Cosmo Pulser Squad.

950
01:22:19,066 --> 01:22:20,667
Sakurai, take Kobayashi's station.

951
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:21,500
WhaEUR''

952
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:22,900
Understood.

953
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,168
l, Kobayashi, will sortie
with the Cosmo Pulser Squad!

954
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:44,135
Don't drop your guard, leader.

955
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:45,000
You too, Miharu.

956
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,734
Hury!

957
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:29,500
They're following us.

958
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,701
All right.

959
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,233
Miharu!

960
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:25,667
We're even now!

961
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:27,734
Just hide behind me
when things get tense.

962
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:32,402
l'll make you eat those words.

963
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:51,766
Sakurai!

964
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,601
Sakurai-san!

965
01:24:56,733 --> 01:24:57,767
l'll take his place.

966
01:24:57,766 --> 01:24:59,667
Gouda, you will direct the battlefield.

967
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:00,533
Understood.

968
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:02,267
l'm fine.

969
01:25:03,633 --> 01:25:04,900
Allow me to continue.

970
01:25:05,566 --> 01:25:07,534
Kamijou, take the command.

971
01:25:10,533 --> 01:25:11,133
Got it.

972
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,535
Crap! It's not responding!

973
01:25:15,533 --> 01:25:18,168
Why has the output dropped
at a moment like this?!

974
01:25:18,133 --> 01:25:21,102
Come on, don't be so fickle!

975
01:25:21,066 --> 01:25:23,635
Shou, let's run another systems check.

976
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:27,769
We're helpless ifwe get the order
to fire the wave-motion cannon!

977
01:25:27,766 --> 01:25:28,833
Yeah.

978
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:32,633
lt has stabilized.

979
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,167
C-Chief!

980
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:45,267
Sou! Shou!

981
01:25:45,233 --> 01:25:47,034
What did l teach you two?

982
01:25:47,033 --> 01:25:49,001
Can't you even use a wrench properly?!

983
01:25:56,133 --> 01:25:57,334
We'll break through the middle!

984
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:58,434
Aim for the stronghold!

985
01:25:58,433 --> 01:25:59,467
Yes, sir!

986
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,768
Kobayashi, the Yamato will
break through the center.

987
01:26:03,766 --> 01:26:04,733
Cover us.

988
01:26:04,733 --> 01:26:05,834
Roger!

989
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:46,301
Maho, analyze that stronghold.

990
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,035
What's that gigantic energy flow?

991
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,902
l'm going to analyze it in the ECl.

992
01:26:53,433 --> 01:26:58,204
Me_ler, when are you going to show me
the demise ofthose monkeys?

993
01:26:58,866 --> 01:27:00,067
Vey soon.

994
01:27:00,566 --> 01:27:03,535
Prepare the hyper neutron beam.

995
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:08,470
Commander, i1we fire now, we
will not only hit our own ships,

996
01:27:08,466 --> 01:27:10,868
but the ships ofthe Alliance as well.

997
01:27:10,866 --> 01:27:12,500
l don't care.

998
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,200
Shoot.

999
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:33,836
All ships, full speed
ahead! Protect the Yamato!

1000
01:28:02,966 --> 01:28:04,467
General Pascal...

1001
01:28:09,633 --> 01:28:12,469
Take care of the rest... Yamato...

1002
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:33,202
Even though they are both part
of the Interstellar Alliance...

1003
01:28:33,233 --> 01:28:34,634
They wiped out their allies as well...

1004
01:28:34,633 --> 01:28:37,435
Relentless SUS bastards!

1005
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,033
That's...

1006
01:28:39,033 --> 01:28:41,969
The otherAlliance fleets are withdrawing.

1007
01:28:45,266 --> 01:28:50,437
Looks like the death of General
Pascal has opened our path.

1008
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,202
We cannot let General
Pascal's death be in vain.

1009
01:28:55,766 --> 01:28:57,968
We mustn't let this chance go, Captain.

1010
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,266
Yes.

1011
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:03,903
But evading that stronghold's
beam is almost impossible.

1012
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:06,902
Damn Yamato... It's still intact.

1013
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:10,535
They don't pose the slightest threatto us.

1014
01:29:10,533 --> 01:29:13,636
Should we fire all canons and
deliverthem to oblivion?

1015
01:29:14,233 --> 01:29:16,168
You're right.

1016
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:17,400
Prepare all canons!

1017
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,169
Prepare to fire all hyper neutron beams!

1018
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:41,167
E-Emergency blow!

1019
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:44,000
Emergency blow!

1020
01:29:51,533 --> 01:29:53,101
Dammit!

1021
01:29:53,633 --> 01:29:55,768
All fighters, pull back!

1022
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:56,533
Hury!

1023
01:30:17,133 --> 01:30:19,335
Damn it! Don't screw with us!

1024
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,534
Fire the batteries!

1025
01:30:24,933 --> 01:30:26,534
Fire bow torpedoes!

1026
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,036
Missiles and main battery
fire are being reflected.

1027
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:55,301
lt must have a strong magnetic field.

1028
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,569
Kamijou, call Cosmo
Pulser Squadron back.

1029
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:00,668
They mustn't get in that
gigantic canon's beam.

1030
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:01,266
Yes, sir.

1031
01:31:01,899 --> 01:31:05,236
Captain, l've got the results
ofthe energy flow analysis.

1032
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,468
l'm putting the results on-screen.

1033
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,569
The energy flow wrapped
around the stronghold

1034
01:31:12,566 --> 01:31:15,702
forms an enormous magnetic lield that serves as
a defensive barrier.

1035
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:20,737
The energy flow comes from the place where the
beam was launched.

1036
01:31:21,066 --> 01:31:24,736
We assume that the canon's
barrel also serves as a shield.

1037
01:31:25,233 --> 01:31:28,202
ln other words, as long as we
don't destroy that shield,

1038
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:33,171
none ofthe Yamato's attacks will ever reach
the central command tower.

1039
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,268
Captain, allow me to borrow the Shinano.

1040
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,767
The Shinano?

1041
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:49,938
The Shinano is equipped with
24 wave energy torpedoes.

1042
01:31:49,899 --> 01:31:53,370
l'm planning on using them
to destroy the shield.

1043
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:56,636
But the missiles haven't been tested yet.

1044
01:31:57,399 --> 01:31:59,935
That's why the young ones
aren't cut out for this.

1045
01:31:59,899 --> 01:32:02,469
l'll test whether they work or not.

1046
01:32:03,033 --> 01:32:04,467
No, that's too dangerous!

1047
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,703
l think they will be eflective
if l launch them at point blank.

1048
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:12,503
There's no other way to
destroy that shield.

1049
01:32:14,233 --> 01:32:15,200
Oomura-san...

1050
01:32:20,033 --> 01:32:22,702
l'll be going, Captain Kodai.

1051
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:53,534
Damn!

1052
01:32:53,533 --> 01:32:54,467
Eat this!

1053
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:20,800
Oomura-san!

1054
01:33:34,033 --> 01:33:38,337
An unmarried man has nothing to lose!

1055
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:48,036
Captain Kodai, can you hear me?

1056
01:33:48,533 --> 01:33:50,801
l can hearyou clearly, Oomura-san.

1057
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,635
The three years l've spent with you...

1058
01:34:02,066 --> 01:34:04,468
That was the best voyage l
could have asked for...

1059
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,301
Thank you for everything.

1060
01:34:09,266 --> 01:34:12,969
l'm counting on you, young ones.

1061
01:34:12,966 --> 01:34:15,601
You have to protect mankind!

1062
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,301
l'm leaving it in your hands!

1063
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:21,901
No matter what kind of
monster you're facing...

1064
01:34:21,866 --> 01:34:24,802
it always has a weakness or two!

1065
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,401
Don't look down on Earth!

1066
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,769
Don't underestimate Space
Battleship Yamato!

1067
01:34:28,733 --> 01:34:30,868
l'll make you feel this one!

1068
01:34:53,466 --> 01:34:54,733
Metzler!

1069
01:34:54,699 --> 01:34:55,634
The shield has...

1070
01:35:00,866 --> 01:35:01,900
Oomura-san...

1071
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:19,636
We will destroy those five towers
before the enemy recovers!

1072
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,601
Prepare the transition
wave-motion cannon!

1073
01:35:22,033 --> 01:35:26,637
Captain, are we going to fire all six rounds o1
the wave motion cannon?

1074
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,568
No, leave one.

1075
01:35:28,566 --> 01:35:31,101
We will fire five beams and
crush those five towers.

1076
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:31,867
Understood!

1077
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,702
Energy level at 1200/o.

1078
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:39,867
Understood.

1079
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:42,601
Activating flywheel!

1080
01:35:50,433 --> 01:35:53,335
Kamijou, align the five beam
cannons with those five towers.

1081
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,300
Do not miss!

1082
01:35:54,533 --> 01:35:55,901
Y-Yes, sir!

1083
01:36:03,766 --> 01:36:07,803
Kamijou-san, l'm sending you the
exact position of the beam gun.

1084
01:36:08,133 --> 01:36:09,834
Thanks, Maho.

1085
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:19,568
Prepare the transition
wave-motion cannon.

1086
01:36:19,933 --> 01:36:21,801
Open the target scope!

1087
01:36:22,633 --> 01:36:25,002
Visual crosshair, brightness 20.

1088
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,534
Everyone brace for shock.

1089
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:28,734
Equip your anti-flash goggles.

1090
01:36:32,066 --> 01:36:34,735
lncreasing wave-motion
energy from 1000/o to 1200/o.

1091
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,068
Kamijou, we're counting on you!

1092
01:36:38,066 --> 01:36:39,233
You can do it!

1093
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,634
Yes, sir!

1094
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,500
5...

1095
01:36:41,533 --> 01:36:42,233

1...

1099
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,467
Fire!

1100
01:37:23,266 --> 01:37:26,002
All beams have hit their targets!

1101
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:40,567
Yay!

1102
01:37:41,466 --> 01:37:43,401
Enemy fire has stopped.

1103
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,234
You did it!

1104
01:37:46,233 --> 01:37:48,401
You did it, Tactical OfFicer Kamijou!

1105
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:50,068
Yahoo!

1106
01:37:50,033 --> 01:37:50,900
Yay!

1107
01:37:51,566 --> 01:37:52,934
We did it!
Thank the heavens.

1108
01:37:54,466 --> 01:37:56,835
Kobayashi, change stations with Sakurai.

1109
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:59,235
lt's too dangerous for him
to continue with that wound.

1110
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,001
Captain, check our 12!

1111
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:06,701
What's that?

1112
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:02,567
Fire all batteries!

1113
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:04,567
Full speed ahead!

1114
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:05,867
Roger!

1115
01:39:20,866 --> 01:39:22,067
Hard to port!

1116
01:39:22,033 --> 01:39:23,367
Full speed ahead!

1117
01:39:24,433 --> 01:39:27,369
That ''space submarine'' is amazing...

1118
01:39:27,966 --> 01:39:31,636
lt can manipulate dimensions and
wander through them freely.

1119
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,034
Second auxiliary canon damaged!

1120
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,100
Torpedo tubes damaged!

1121
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:36,101
Anti-air turrets on starboard
are seriously damaged!

1122
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,033
Full speed ahead!

1123
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,067
Towards the sun!

1124
01:40:08,899 --> 01:40:10,001
The sun?

1125
01:40:10,466 --> 01:40:12,201
l don't have time to explain.

1126
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:12,767
Just move!

1127
01:40:12,766 --> 01:40:13,933
O-Okay.

1128
01:40:13,933 --> 01:40:15,167
Understood.

1129
01:40:15,133 --> 01:40:16,501
Moving toward the sun!

1130
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:46,203
lncrease the wave
engine's output to 1200/o!

1131
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:47,534
Understood!
Understood!

1132
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:04,234
W-What?

1133
01:41:04,533 --> 01:41:05,667
Kamijou.

1134
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:09,903
Aim the transition wave
cannon at the sun.

1135
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:16,468
We discovered that it is linked
to the enemy's power supply.

1136
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,836
That's an artificial astral
body camouflaged as a star!

1137
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:21,968
The SUS's power source!

1138
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,467
Understood!

1139
01:41:26,899 --> 01:41:28,201
Target: the sun.

1140
01:41:28,433 --> 01:41:30,101
Prepare to fire the wave-motion cannon.

1141
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,901
Kamijou, shoot at the appropriate timing.

1142
01:41:31,899 --> 01:41:32,200
Yes, sir!

1143
01:41:32,933 --> 01:41:35,368
Open the target scope.

1144
01:41:35,366 --> 01:41:37,201
Equip your anti-flash goggles
and brace yourselves.

1145
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:40,702
Firing the wave motion cannon!

1146
01:41:58,733 --> 01:42:00,034
No good?

1147
01:43:49,433 --> 01:43:52,502
Something is appearing on the screen.

1148
01:44:07,033 --> 01:44:07,833
Wait!

1149
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,701
Human.

1150
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:33,937
We are diflerent from you;

1151
01:44:33,933 --> 01:44:36,802
we are many but we are one.

1152
01:44:37,966 --> 01:44:41,202
We were merely sent to
maintain this universe,

1153
01:44:41,766 --> 01:44:47,738
and must seize this dimension.

1154
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,734
Sent?

1155
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:55,304
We'll give this world to you.

1156
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,568
You may rule it.

1157
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,035
We won't rule it.

1158
01:45:00,033 --> 01:45:01,434
We want to live together.

1159
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:03,368
That's what this world means to us.

1160
01:45:09,133 --> 01:45:12,736
Human, l cannot understand your kind.

1161
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:39,934
ls this nightmare over?

1162
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:41,767
l don't know.

1163
01:45:41,733 --> 01:45:44,702
l still can't believe what l saw.

1164
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:49,237
There's one thing we know for sure now.

1165
01:45:49,266 --> 01:45:54,704
What the SUS presented us
as the ''truth'' is a lie.

1166
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,536
My dear citizens of Amarl.

1167
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,702
We have made noble sacrifices.

1168
01:46:10,433 --> 01:46:13,969
And thanks to the eHorts
of Space Battleship Yamato,

1169
01:46:13,966 --> 01:46:18,403
we have finally won our independence.

1170
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:21,202
This independence we have achieved

1171
01:46:22,266 --> 01:46:26,203
must be protected with honor forever.

1172
01:46:32,533 --> 01:46:33,300
lt's the Yamato!

1173
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,168
The Yamato is returning to Earth!

1174
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:42,967
Yamato...

1175
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:10,770
We will arrive at the first long
warp point in five minutes.

1176
01:47:10,766 --> 01:47:11,867
All right!

1177
01:47:11,866 --> 01:47:14,468
We'll go straight to Earth!

1178
01:47:16,533 --> 01:47:17,433
Warp!

1179
01:47:26,033 --> 01:47:27,667
The emigration fleet has returned.

1180
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,734
Good.

1181
01:47:29,733 --> 01:47:33,169
Once the fleet has landed,
begin maintenance.

1182
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,135
We will depart in twelve hours.

1183
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,935
Now we have to wait for the Yamato.

1184
01:47:55,233 --> 01:47:56,767
Warp finished.

1185
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:13,768
We've caught up with the
Cascading Black Hole!

1186
01:48:13,766 --> 01:48:15,734
Transferring the processed visuals.

1187
01:48:15,733 --> 01:48:17,701
Height: circa 304,OOO km.

1188
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,935
Width: circa 338,OOO km.

1189
01:48:19,933 --> 01:48:22,101
lt's several times biggerthan Jupiter.

1190
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:25,002
l-ls that thing going to swallow the Earth?

1191
01:48:25,366 --> 01:48:27,801
lt's like the Devil's mouth.

1192
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,035
Maho, what's its location?

1193
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:36,138
At 14:05 the center will be
on a galactic latitude of 8

1194
01:48:36,133 --> 01:48:37,000
What's its velocity?

1195
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:39,334
29,OOO kmrs.

1196
01:48:45,399 --> 01:48:48,636
lt'll hit the outer reaches of
the Solar System in three days.

1197
01:48:49,966 --> 01:48:53,135
The Earth will be
destroyed in three days!

1198
01:49:04,233 --> 01:49:06,101
Hurry up! We'll pe_orm the next warp!

1199
01:49:16,333 --> 01:49:18,868
Chief! Pluto has been swallowed!

1200
01:49:19,233 --> 01:49:23,236
lt swallowed Pluto, with a 2274
km diameter, just like that!

1201
01:49:23,233 --> 01:49:24,534
Processing the visuals.

1202
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,601
Playing it in slow-motion.

1203
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,935
What a monster!

1204
01:49:39,933 --> 01:49:42,101
How long does the Earth have?

1205
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:43,134
Three more days.

1206
01:49:46,133 --> 01:49:48,735
Hurry up and get on the craft!

1207
01:49:49,033 --> 01:49:50,834
Hurry! We don't have any time!

1208
01:49:58,233 --> 01:49:59,767
Dr. Sado!

1209
01:49:59,733 --> 01:50:01,267
The rescue craft has arrived.

1210
01:50:01,666 --> 01:50:03,501
l'm staying here.

1211
01:50:03,466 --> 01:50:05,134
Me too.

1212
01:50:05,133 --> 01:50:08,469
Humans eventually die.

1213
01:50:08,466 --> 01:50:11,902
l've got so many memories here.

1214
01:50:11,933 --> 01:50:14,201
l'm fine with that.

1215
01:50:15,766 --> 01:50:17,167
Doctor...

1216
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:18,200
But...

1217
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:23,970
Miyuki-chan, if you disappeared as well,

1218
01:50:23,966 --> 01:50:26,201
yourfatherwould be all alone.

1219
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:32,705
Kodai has been lighting because his beloved
ones are waiting for him.

1220
01:50:33,333 --> 01:50:38,471
All the lights and journeys
ofthe Yamato were like that.

1221
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:43,904
l believe it was because there was
always someone waiting for him.

1222
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,400
But...

1223
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,968
What a pain!

1224
01:50:48,933 --> 01:50:49,967
Analyzer!

1225
01:50:49,966 --> 01:50:51,667
Roger!

1226
01:50:55,266 --> 01:50:57,401
Analyzer! Let go of me!

1227
01:50:57,666 --> 01:50:59,901
Please continue to live, Miyuki-san.

1228
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:01,734
Analyzer!

1229
01:51:01,733 --> 01:51:03,334
Bye!

1230
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:42,536
Space Battleship Yamato
has returned to Earth!

1231
01:51:42,533 --> 01:51:44,434
Thank you, Kodai.

1232
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:45,334
l'm really sorry.

1233
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,002
Sanada-san, we don't have any time.

1234
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,836
Board the last remaining
people onto the Yamato.

1235
01:51:50,833 --> 01:51:52,868
Okay, l understand.

1236
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,370
Chief, the last emigrant
vessel has departed.

1237
01:52:15,699 --> 01:52:16,734
Okay.

1238
01:52:16,733 --> 01:52:19,902
l hope they make it safely to Amarl.

1239
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:22,634
What about you?

1240
01:52:23,566 --> 01:52:25,501
l will stay here.

1241
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,634
Chief!

1242
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,672
As a scientist, l want to witness the
Earth until its vey last moment.

1243
01:52:44,566 --> 01:52:46,134
Sanada-san said that?

1244
01:52:50,566 --> 01:52:51,967
l see.

1245
01:52:52,533 --> 01:52:55,202
Shima, are you done
housing all the people?

1246
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,000
No.

1247
01:52:56,466 --> 01:53:00,469
The emergency craft that Sanada-san
arranged for the Field Park

1248
01:53:00,466 --> 01:53:02,000
still hasn't returned.

1249
01:53:02,733 --> 01:53:03,967
Field Park?

1250
01:53:04,366 --> 01:53:07,402
The one that Dr. Sado
and Miyuki-san boarded?

1251
01:53:07,933 --> 01:53:08,767
Yes...

1252
01:53:17,766 --> 01:53:20,969
What are you doing, Tactical O_icer?

1253
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:25,537
They lost contact with the emergency craft
occupied by the captain's daughter.

1254
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,067
What?

1255
01:53:26,066 --> 01:53:27,167
ln that case, l will go!

1256
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:28,934
l won't allow individual decisions!

1257
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,334
Captain!

1258
01:53:30,866 --> 01:53:32,901
Kobayashi, get back to your station!

1259
01:53:32,899 --> 01:53:34,434
You too, Kamijou!

1260
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:39,004
Captain, aren't you going
to help your daughter?!

1261
01:53:39,666 --> 01:53:42,201
You still call yourself a father?!

1262
01:53:42,199 --> 01:53:43,968
Are you the captain of the Yamato?!

1263
01:53:45,033 --> 01:53:47,635
Didn't you hear me, Kobayashi?

1264
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,767
Return to your post!

1265
01:54:04,733 --> 01:54:05,700
That is...

1266
01:54:05,699 --> 01:54:06,867
Captain Kodai!

1267
01:54:07,166 --> 01:54:10,369
So he planned to go by
himselffrom the start.

1268
01:54:10,333 --> 01:54:11,567
Damn!

1269
01:54:11,566 --> 01:54:14,302
l can't believe l said that!

1270
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,869
He did that to stop us from going, too.

1271
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,868
Where are you, Miyuki?

1272
01:54:25,866 --> 01:54:27,434
42 minutes left.

1273
01:54:51,433 --> 01:54:53,101
Miyuki! Miyuki!

1274
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,102
F-Father...

1275
01:54:59,033 --> 01:55:00,634
Can you get out?

1276
01:55:07,366 --> 01:55:08,533
Father!

1277
01:55:09,333 --> 01:55:11,134
Miyuki, are you okay?

1278
01:55:11,466 --> 01:55:12,466
Yeah...

1279
01:55:12,466 --> 01:55:14,134
Take this, Miyuki.

1280
01:55:15,433 --> 01:55:16,534
This is...

1281
01:55:17,899 --> 01:55:19,368
Mom's...

1282
01:55:19,366 --> 01:55:21,601
Yes, your mother isn't in Heaven yet.

1283
01:55:22,233 --> 01:55:24,702
She's somewhere out there in space.

1284
01:55:24,733 --> 01:55:26,101
l will find her the next time for sure!

1285
01:55:26,366 --> 01:55:28,000
Come with me.

1286
01:55:27,966 --> 01:55:28,933
Okay.

1287
01:55:34,899 --> 01:55:36,101
Father...

1288
01:55:37,466 --> 01:55:38,834
Don't throw your life away.

1289
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,968
l guess it's about time.

1290
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:27,069
Kodai, when first l saw you,

1291
01:56:27,066 --> 01:56:29,835
l believe you were still 18,

1292
01:56:30,433 --> 01:56:32,835
we boarded the Yamato together,

1293
01:56:33,166 --> 01:56:37,770
and later you and Mori Yuki
gave birth to Miyuki-chan.

1294
01:56:43,766 --> 01:56:45,868
Take care of Miyuki-chan.

1295
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,035
However...

1296
01:56:51,033 --> 01:56:56,738
l thought the animals would anticipate the danger,
and start running away or crying.

1297
01:56:56,733 --> 01:56:59,869
Mii-kun, you are like their exact opposite.

1298
01:57:04,066 --> 01:57:05,700
Come here.

1299
01:57:06,266 --> 01:57:08,534
Even if you're a little kitty,

1300
01:57:08,533 --> 01:57:13,871
are you still prepared lorthe
inevitability of destiny?

1301
01:59:14,333 --> 01:59:15,033
Thank you!

1302
01:59:15,033 --> 01:59:16,134
Farewell!

1303
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:17,334
Thank you for everything, Earth!

1304
01:59:17,366 --> 01:59:18,667
Thank you!

1305
01:59:18,699 --> 01:59:20,201
Thanks for the wonde_ul memories!

1306
01:59:20,166 --> 01:59:20,866
Thank you!

1307
01:59:21,033 --> 01:59:23,668
l'll never forget you!
Farewell!

1308
01:59:24,033 --> 01:59:25,401
Thank you!

1309
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:27,335
Farewell!

1310
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:33,867
Farewell!
Thank you!

1311
01:59:33,866 --> 01:59:35,267
Farewell!

1312
01:59:35,266 --> 01:59:37,234
l'll never forget you!

1313
01:59:37,233 --> 01:59:38,367
Thank you!

1314
01:59:38,966 --> 01:59:39,800
Thank you!

1315
01:59:39,833 --> 01:59:42,869
Thank you!
Farewell!

1316
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:45,802
l'll never forget you!

1317
01:59:47,566 --> 01:59:49,100
Farewell!
Farewell, Earth!

1318
01:59:49,866 --> 01:59:52,902
Thank you so much!

1319
01:59:52,866 --> 01:59:54,601
Farewell!

1320
02:00:09,033 --> 02:00:13,437
Humankind is about to lose the
thing most precious to us.

1321
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:18,103
We have come to realize this fartoo late.

1322
02:00:19,166 --> 02:00:23,703
Humans have always had the
worst attitude toward her.

1323
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:28,270
We stole, destroyed,
wrecked, and rebuilt.

1324
02:00:28,266 --> 02:00:31,035
We thought we ruled over everything.

1325
02:00:32,266 --> 02:00:38,205
From the point of view ofthe immeasurable universe,
this is just another inconsequential event.

1326
02:00:39,066 --> 02:00:41,468
We can't even save the Earth.

1327
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,501
We're so powerless.

1328
02:00:45,366 --> 02:00:48,502
Ultimately, we failed.

1329
02:00:49,466 --> 02:00:54,737
Moving to a new planet is
but a chance to start over.

1330
02:01:00,733 --> 02:01:01,366
What's this?

1331
02:01:15,166 --> 02:01:16,367
That's...

1332
02:01:17,333 --> 02:01:18,133
You're...

1333
02:01:18,133 --> 02:01:19,834
You were still alive?!

1334
02:01:20,666 --> 02:01:23,635
l've been waiting forthis.

1335
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:28,103
The time has come for Earth to
become a part of our dimension.

1336
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:32,370
What appears to be a black hole to you,

1337
02:01:32,366 --> 02:01:36,002
is a door leading to our dimension.

1338
02:01:35,966 --> 02:01:40,670
The immense energy torrent that
is created by the flux capacitor

1339
02:01:40,666 --> 02:01:44,636
is merely creating a little
interdimensional crack.

1340
02:01:44,633 --> 02:01:47,335
What lies on the other side ofthat crack

1341
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:51,237
is a dimension that is beyond
anything you can fathom.

1342
02:01:51,233 --> 02:01:56,538
However, there aren't many planetary systems
or stars that can serve as resources there.

1343
02:01:56,533 --> 02:02:01,104
We had no other choice butto get provisions
from other dimensions in order to survive.

1344
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:09,140
On top ofthat, in order to
survive, we have chosen your world.

1345
02:02:10,733 --> 02:02:17,840
All things in space are essential
resources for our dimension.

1346
02:02:17,866 --> 02:02:22,103
Humans, stars, organisms,
inorganic substances...

1347
02:02:22,066 --> 02:02:25,335
Evey single atom serves
to feed our dimension.

1348
02:02:26,066 --> 02:02:30,069
EaRh, you shall be
devoured by our dimension!

1349
02:02:31,833 --> 02:02:35,269
Every living being

1350
02:02:35,266 --> 02:02:41,405
will be reborn as our new energy supply.

1351
02:02:44,866 --> 02:02:47,935
Farewell, Kodai.

1352
02:02:56,433 --> 02:02:57,600
l see!

1353
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,568
lt was man-made.

1354
02:02:59,533 --> 02:03:03,069
Then there's something that
operates the flux capacitor.

1355
02:03:03,633 --> 02:03:06,168
Maho, use the full capacity
of the computer room,

1356
02:03:06,166 --> 02:03:08,401
and find where that
interdimensional crack is!

1357
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:09,134
Yes, sir.

1358
02:03:11,433 --> 02:03:13,668
Don't give up until the bitter end!

1359
02:03:13,666 --> 02:03:15,534
All hands, prepare for battle!

1360
02:03:15,866 --> 02:03:17,067
Understood!

1361
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,201
The flux capacitor...

1362
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:26,634
The crack in our dimension...

1363
02:03:26,633 --> 02:03:28,034
Where... Where is it?

1364
02:03:37,566 --> 02:03:38,934
That's it!

1365
02:03:38,933 --> 02:03:42,569
l've found the spot with the
highest energy emission.

1366
02:03:42,566 --> 02:03:43,333
Putting it on-screen.

1367
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,870
lt's 300 km away from the gaseous entrance,
on the su_ace near the center.

1368
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:52,302
So that's the black hole's true form?

1369
02:03:52,966 --> 02:03:53,599
All right!

1370
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:55,301
Prepare the transition
wave-motion cannon!

1371
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:56,434
Understood!

1372
02:03:56,433 --> 02:03:58,802
Engine room, prepare the
transition wave-motion cannon!

1373
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:04,537
Captain, keep the influence of the gravity sphere
created by the crack in mind,

1374
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:08,570
orthe wave-motion cannon's energy
will be stripped when we fire it.

1375
02:04:09,033 --> 02:04:10,801
We will fire once.

1376
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:15,504
How about shooting all
six rounds at once?

1377
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,001
Maho, calculate the feasibility.

1378
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:18,533
Understood!

1379
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:21,068
All six rounds at once?!

1380
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:25,570
Otherwise we cannot
destroy that monster!

1381
02:04:26,766 --> 02:04:29,468
Captain, it's theoretically possible.

1382
02:04:29,433 --> 02:04:30,267
Just...

1383
02:04:30,266 --> 02:04:31,066
Just what?

1384
02:04:31,699 --> 02:04:33,868
Even ifwe manage to fire,

1385
02:04:33,866 --> 02:04:36,068
we don't know if the
Yamato can handle it.

1386
02:04:36,533 --> 02:04:38,835
The Yamato isn't the one
we need to protect!

1387
02:04:39,866 --> 02:04:40,666
lt's the Earth!

1388
02:04:41,766 --> 02:04:44,135
lf, by doing this, we
can protect the Earth,

1389
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:47,069
no one will complain, Captain!

1390
02:04:47,399 --> 02:04:48,267
Chief!

1391
02:04:48,266 --> 02:04:48,966
What's wrong?

1392
02:04:49,866 --> 02:04:52,868
The whole firing system
is modifying itself!

1393
02:04:53,566 --> 02:04:56,168
The program was protected until now.

1394
02:04:56,133 --> 02:04:58,268
Because of the calculations
in the computer room,

1395
02:04:58,266 --> 02:05:00,034
the program has launched itself.

1396
02:05:00,033 --> 02:05:00,867
Putting it on-screen!

1397
02:05:06,133 --> 02:05:07,334
lt's Sanada-san!

1398
02:05:08,266 --> 02:05:12,370
So there were things about the
Yamato we didn't know yet.

1399
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,835
As expected from Sanada-san.

1400
02:05:14,866 --> 02:05:17,735
But, he didn't implement it oflicially

1401
02:05:17,733 --> 02:05:22,370
as it's too risky and shouldn't
be used unless it's an emergency.

1402
02:05:23,066 --> 02:05:24,367
Let's do it, Captain.

1403
02:05:24,699 --> 02:05:28,336
First and second wave-motion
engine energy levels at 1200/o!

1404
02:05:28,933 --> 02:05:30,668
Preparing all rounds forfire.

1405
02:05:46,633 --> 02:05:48,668
Yamato, full speed ahead!

1406
02:06:10,633 --> 02:06:13,635
Captain, we have three
minutes and 20 seconds left!

1407
02:06:14,133 --> 02:06:15,667
Sou, Shou, get ready!

1408
02:06:16,066 --> 02:06:17,367
Y-Yes, sir!

1409
02:06:17,366 --> 02:06:19,167
We're ready anytime!

1410
02:06:24,066 --> 02:06:25,133
Kamijou!

1411
02:06:25,133 --> 02:06:26,667
Move, Kamijou!

1412
02:06:26,666 --> 02:06:27,600
l'll do it!

1413
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,534
Captain!

1414
02:06:30,233 --> 02:06:32,134
Eveyone, cover your eyes!

1415
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,471
l'm putting the fate of Earth and
the Solar System on the line.

1416
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,267
Fire!

1417
02:09:41,133 --> 02:09:43,869
The infinite expanse ofthe universe...

1418
02:09:45,533 --> 02:09:48,269
A place filled with silence and light...

1419
02:09:50,033 --> 02:09:52,735
lfthere are stars that die,

1420
02:09:52,733 --> 02:09:54,901
then there are also stars that are born.

1421
02:09:58,433 --> 02:09:59,534
Yes...

1422
02:10:00,766 --> 02:10:04,136
The universe is alive.
