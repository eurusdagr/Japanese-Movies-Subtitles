1
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:10,028
Karin!

2
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:16,370
I found Yuuji.

3
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:44,221
Hey,

4
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,427
why does he only draw pictures of garbage?

5
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:50,130
He knows how it feels to be abandoned.

6
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,072
Abandoned?

7
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:59,569
Yuuji was put into my orphanage by his mom when his dad died.

8
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:04,077
She made a promise before leaving.

9
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,214
That she'll come for him when she has enough money.

10
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,053
He's still waiting for her, believing that promise.

11
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:12,423
Then, eventually...

12
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,426
There's no way she'll come back.

13
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:16,992
What?

14
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:21,159
Yuuji was abandoned, just like me.

15
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,702
Karin! My head aches!

16
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:31,811
I always tell you, don't concentrate too hard.

17
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,948
Let's go home.

18
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:36,881
Okay.

19
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,487
Bye, Satoshi.

20
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,683
Bye-bye.

21
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:09,006
Yuuji...

22
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,522
You really came.

23
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:33,430
He works in the same art supplies shop as me.

24
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:37,768
He fell from his motorcycle on the way home.

25
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:47,883
This is...

26
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:52,757
Yuuji found your shop's article by chance.

27
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,161
Momoka!

28
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:58,828
Look, look, look at this!

29
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:00,493
Here.

30
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:03,669
"Trash" is the name of our dog.

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,173
He was looking forward to surprising you with his own art exhibition.

32
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:15,244
Then, why didn't he send that postcard?

33
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:19,352
His exhibition was cancelled.

34
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,180
Cancelled?

35
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:27,386
It was Yuuji's mother who brought the idea of an art exhibition.

36
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,961
His mother?

37
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,064
He met his mother?

38
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,563
His mother said she was going out with a famous art dealer for some art gallery.

39
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,405
He liked Yuuji's drawings,

40
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,343
so they were going to open an art exhibition and sell his drawings.

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,810
Yes, I deposited the money this morning.

42
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,313
Thank you.

43
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:50,779
Oh, and...

44
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,613
please take a good care of my mother.

45
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,891
He became ecstatic,

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,333
and even borrowed money to make it happen.

47
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,700
But...

48
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:14,432
[ This number is no longer being used. ]

49
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,804
[ Please call again with the right number. ]

50
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:24,918
The whole deal was a lie.

51
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:27,684
They defrauded his money.

52
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:30,484
They betrayed you!

53
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,384
It's a fraud!

54
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,918
Let's report to the police!

55
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,726
It doesn't matter for me.

56
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,291
As long as that money helps my mom and her boyfriend...

57
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,168
It's fine by me.

58
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:53,647
This is the sketchbook he always carried around.

59
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:09,796
He always drew that picture when he hit a dead end.

60
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:22,878
"I have at least two true friends who believed I can become an artist,"

61
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:24,869
he said.

62
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:32,683
Yuuji...

63
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,485
Hey, let's go.

64
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,659
Back then...

65
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,993
...the three of us were here all the time.

66
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,899
But...

67
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:32,504
sometimes, I think...

68
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:41,242
Maybe everything happened in this town was a dream.

69
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,957
It's not a dream.

70
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:58,302
Because Yuuji waited for us in this very town.

71
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:02,973
You're moving?

72
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:07,410
My mom is being transferred to a hospital far away.

73
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,214
You'll be going to another school?

74
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:11,781
Yes.

75
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:25,364
But I'm sure we'll meet again.

76
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:30,364
The three of us will always be together.

77
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:41,841
It's a promise.

78
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,274
- Promise.
- Promise.

79
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,624
Satoshi.

80
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,329
We're friends, no matter how far apart we are.

81
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,988
Karin! Satoshi is leaving!

82
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,563
Yuuji, I'm counting on you to look after Karin.

83
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,100
Good bye.

84
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:14,907
Satoshi!

85
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,283
Karin!

86
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,383
Karin!

87
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,183
Karin, let's go.

88
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:40,259
I'll stay by Yuuji's side.

89
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,462
I'll stay here.

90
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,975
To be honest, I...

91
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:56,236
I don't think I'll ever come back.

92
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:04,215
I'm glad I got to see you.

93
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:10,354
Take care.

94
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:41,846
Good bye.

95
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:12,008
Karin...

96
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:16,915
Karin!

97
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:20,761
Karin...

98
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,826
Aren't you worried?

99
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,667
Yuuji has Karin with him.

100
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:37,802
I'm talking about Karin.

101
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,871
I wonder why she visited you all of a sudden?

102
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,882
Because...

103
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:52,452
She came to my bakery a few days ago.

104
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:56,889
"Look after Satoshi for me,"

105
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:59,050
she asked me.

106
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:10,269
She loves you.

107
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:21,140
What am I saying?

108
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:25,953
Misaki...

109
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:31,316
I can forgive you for being oblivious to women.

110
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:36,957
But you can't be oblivious to your own feelings.

111
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,488
I'm sure Satoshi loves you.

112
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,433
Really?

113
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:21,471
It would make me really happy...

114
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:24,322
...if you married into this family someday.

115
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:50,461
Let's beat our illnesses together, Karin.

116
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:52,706
Yes.

117
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,134
Mom...

118
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:49,990
Is that the medicine Karin was taking?

119
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:51,029
Dad.

120
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:58,662
These are just sleeping pills.

121
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:01,172
No,

122
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:04,905
it's a medicine that prevents sleep.

123
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,342
Karin doesn't have much time left.

124
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,386
She was sick.

125
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,650
Sick?

126
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:21,922
An illness where she can't wake up once fallen into deep sleep.

127
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:30,627
She had only been allowed momentary sleep ever since she was little.

128
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:35,331
Even the most powerful medicine is no longer working for her.

129
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,981
What happens if she falls into deep sleep?

130
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:51,791
She'll slip into coma,

131
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,351
and eventually...

132
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:56,860
...die.

133
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,016
She said she's scared of dying,

134
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:18,279
that she can't stay here any longer.

135
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:26,718
She asked me not to tell you,

136
00:18:27,094 --> 00:18:28,288
and cried.

137
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,764
But I thought you should know.

138
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,542
Dad...

139
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:52,781
Karin came to see you one last time.

140
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,657
Satoshi.

141
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,593
Trash!

142
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,064
Trash died...

143
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:44,637
It didn't die.

144
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:48,541
Look, it's just sleeping.

145
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,003
It died.

146
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,473
It didn't die!

147
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:53,837
Trash died.

148
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,347
It didn't die.

149
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:57,775
It didn't die.

150
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,910
It didn't die.

151
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,381
It didn't die!

152
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,366
Karin!

153
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,697
Karin, wake up.

154
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,041
Wake up!

155
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:05,617
Satoshi.

156
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,218
Why are you here?

157
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:15,293
You won't die, right?

158
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,628
You're just sleeping, right?

159
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm sorry.

160
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,306
I couldn't tell you.

161
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,853
I couldn't tell you either...

162
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,721
...that I loved you.

163
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:58,193
I loved you since I was little.

164
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:05,835
Satoshi...

165
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,887
Good bye.

166
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,235
I'll be waiting.

167
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:39,543
I'll wait forever, until you wake up.

168
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:45,317
Satoshi...

169
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,521
I'll be waiting forever.

170
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:08,636
Karin?

171
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:15,209
Karin!

172
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,820
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

173
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:33,886
How I wonder what you are.

174
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,597
Yuuji...

175
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:20,766
I've heard of it when I was little.

176
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:26,007
An illness where you can't wake up once you fall asleep.

177
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:31,211
Once captured by the dream,

178
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:35,585
they die in bed without ever waking up.

179
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,992
I met Karin in my dream.

180
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,233
She told me to hurry and go back.

181
00:25:58,312 --> 00:26:00,946
I said let's go back together,

182
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,850
but she shook her head and said it was impossible.

183
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:16,788
I think it was just a dream.

184
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,192
But...

185
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:29,041
I want to believe she saved me.

186
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:52,721
She might be upset if I showed this to you, but...

187
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,945
[ Dear Yuuji. ]

188
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:21,314
[ I'm praying you would wake up and read this. ]

189
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:30,998
[ Actually, ]

190
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:34,773
[ I met Satoshi. ]

191
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:40,005
[ Reunion after 13 years. ]

192
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:46,215
[ Yuuji, do you remember? ]

193
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:49,447
I'm Tooyama Satoshi, I moved here a week ago!

194
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:53,988
[ About the first time we met Satoshi. ]

195
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,222
Also, he's "Trash".

196
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:58,187
Nice to meet you, Trash.

197
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:05,132
[ I think I fell in love with Satoshi ever since that day. ]

198
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:11,168
Then, model for the artist,

199
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:13,412
and mascot girl for the aqua plants shop.

200
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:15,380
It's a promise.

201
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:16,907
Promise.

202
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:21,982
[ Satoshi gave me the hope to live. ]

203
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:28,694
Geez, what the hell?

204
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:30,092
Great,

205
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,891
one more! Ready?

206
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:34,931
[ Even for someone like me, ]

207
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:37,732
[ just maybe, ]

208
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:41,374
[ a happy future was waiting for me when I grew up. ]

209
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:49,371
[ I wanted to be by Satoshi's side forever. ]

210
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:52,450
Bye.

211
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:55,322
[ Satoshi was... ]

212
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:56,223
Satoshi!

213
00:28:56,223 --> 00:28:58,418
[ ...my first love. ]

214
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,649
[ That's why, on the day Satoshi left, ]

215
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:08,424
[ to make up for not being able to tell him I love him, ]

216
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:15,095
[ I kissed for the first time in my life. ]

217
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:49,571
[ I've lived my entire life, ]

218
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:56,475
[ with that fond memory as an encouragement. ]

219
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:01,476
[ Even if we're far, far apart... ]

220
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:05,016
[ I'm sure we'll continue to shine forever. ]

221
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:10,489
[ Believing we'll meet again. 
Somewhere, someday. ]

222
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:25,840
[ But... I couldn't escape from my illness. ]

223
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:33,145
[ That's when... ]

224
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:49,463
[ I thought maybe God gave me one last chance. ]

225
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,064
Satoshi!

226
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:01,442
[ Only a limited time left for me, ]

227
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:06,348
[ I had to see you, no matter what. ]

228
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:18,055
[ I wanted to tell you what I couldn't for the longest time. ]

229
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:34,136
Aqua plants shop, "Trash".

230
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,814
[ Satoshi, ]

231
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:45,716
[ it surprised me how you didn't change at all. ]

232
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:49,992
Have some coffee if you like.

233
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:51,086
Ow, hot!

234
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:54,232
[ Clumsy, and... ]

235
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:57,798
Why don't you notice?!

236
00:31:57,904 --> 00:31:59,731
[ Oblivious... ]

237
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,999
Honestly, I can barely stay in the business, but...

238
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,074
it's a promise I made as a child.

239
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:07,510
[ But you were still a pure and... ]

240
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:10,545
That's Microsorium Narrow Leaf.

241
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:13,548
[ A kind person. ]

242
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:20,792
[ You were still the same Satoshi I loved. ]

243
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:23,119
Thank you.

244
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:29,996
[ That's why... ]

245
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:33,938
[ ...I couldn't tell you again. ]

246
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:42,743
[ Because I wasn't in your future. ]

247
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,545
I found it!

248
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:59,454
[ The truth is... I wanted to be by Satoshi's side forever. ]

249
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:11,207
[ I wanted to at least tell him, "I love you." ]

250
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:16,574
[ But... ]

251
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:40,596
[ This is my fate. ]

252
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:45,877
[ But you know, ]

253
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,004
[ I'm glad, ]

254
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,378
[ I met you two again one last time. ]

255
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:11,028
[ I pray that Satoshi and Yuuji will be... ]

256
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:20,746
[ ...happy, forever and ever. ]

257
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:27,249
[ That's why, ]

258
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:29,947
[ if... ]

259
00:34:30,557 --> 00:34:34,822
[ you wake up and see Satoshi, ]

260
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:42,461
[ When you see him... ]

261
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,828
[ When you see him, ]

262
00:34:48,308 --> 00:34:52,408
[ Say hello for me. ]

263
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:02,879
Satoshi...

264
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:33,912
Is it fate,

265
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,582
this mystifying reunion of us three?

266
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:49,687
You three were bonded by a strong force.

267
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:57,397
There's a powerful force in this world,

268
00:36:57,404 --> 00:37:00,034
that can't be explained by physics.

269
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:06,939
It doesn't weaken no matter how much time and space separated you.

270
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:13,545
That's why you were able to reunite like this even after more than 10 years.

271
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:20,521
[ Hey, Karin. ]

272
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:25,559
[ We were connected by an invisible force. ]

273
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:29,935
[ Ever since that place, 13 years ago. ]

274
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:35,172
( Trash )

275
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,811
I've decided the name of my shop.

276
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:46,115
When I become the owner of an aqua plants shop,

277
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,414
I'll name it "Trash".

278
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:52,683
You're the mascot girl for Trash.

279
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:45,272
Hey, Karin. Do you remember?

280
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:47,175
The seeds of water lily.

281
00:38:49,015 --> 00:38:53,281
It may take more than 50 years to sprout up.

282
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:57,787
But it will definitely sprout one day.

283
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,087
It will wake up.

284
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,581
[ I don't care if you stay asleep. ]

285
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:30,983
[ I'll keep talking to you. ]

286
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:46,863
How long will you be staying in Paris?

287
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:50,365
I want to train myself until I'm satisfied.

288
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,099
I see.

289
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:58,912
Chocolate danish.

290
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:02,018
My last and greatest masterpiece.

291
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:04,647
Thank you.

292
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:08,421
Satoshi.

293
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:15,694
Waiting is not easy, is it?

294
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,269
But...

295
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:26,438
I think it's wonderful that you're accepting your own feelings now.

296
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,577
Misaki...

297
00:40:32,886 --> 00:40:34,410
I'll write you.

298
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,482
Good luck.

299
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,319
You too.

300
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:55,772
Hey, Karin.

301
00:40:56,876 --> 00:40:59,868
Yuuji and Momoka has a baby now.

302
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:03,208
I'm sure it's a cute baby.

303
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,027
( And so, Nello and Patrasche woke up,
and lived happily ever after. )

304
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:11,315
Thank you so much for everything.

305
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:22,231
[ Natsume finally became a certified accountant. ]

306
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,101
[ I'm stumped! ]

307
00:41:25,638 --> 00:41:29,703
[ Now I have to place orders and do the packaging all by myself. ]

308
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,970
[ Delivery too. ]

309
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:35,579
Hey,

310
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:37,677
Karin.

311
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:53,328
His eyes look exactly like Yuuji's!

312
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,063
Her name is Haruka.

313
00:41:56,202 --> 00:41:59,365
Oh, I see.

314
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:05,672
I wish Karin can see her.

315
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:23,522
[ Hey, Karin. ]

316
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:28,998
[ I can wait for you, right? ]

317
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:46,077
[ You'll wake up again someday, right? ]

318
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:50,722
[ I can believe in you, right? ]

319
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:54,351
[ Hey, ]

320
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:58,220
[ Karin? ]

321
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:21,681
Thank you very much.

322
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:43,833
Can you switch these two?

323
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,868
Thank you.

324
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,545
Hey, Satoshi.

325
00:43:48,848 --> 00:43:49,837
Congratulations.

326
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:50,847
Thank you.

327
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,783
My dad wanted to come too, but...

328
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:56,216
He's still not feeling well?

329
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:57,386
Yes.

330
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:02,494
At last.

331
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,157
It took 5 years though.

332
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:12,067
A lot of things happened on the way,

333
00:44:13,873 --> 00:44:16,637
but I think they were all meaningful.

334
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:33,315
I drew it for Karin.

335
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:39,791
By the time I realized how I felt about her,

336
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:43,090
she was already in love with you.

337
00:44:51,744 --> 00:44:53,272
I think maybe...

338
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,381
Karin was hoping you would wait for her.

339
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,237
I was dreaming.

340
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:06,917
A dream of when you were born.

341
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:17,284
It was a difficult delivery.

342
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,930
Your mom and I,

343
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:28,337
we were in tears from happiness.

344
00:46:34,213 --> 00:46:38,313
It's was the first time in my life...

345
00:46:42,555 --> 00:46:45,255
...I felt so warm inside.

346
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:52,794
I'm sorry.

347
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,001
What is it?

348
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:03,532
I should've...

349
00:47:05,945 --> 00:47:08,135
...started a family,

350
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:12,716
so you wouldn't worry about me.

351
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:35,803
You should live the way you want to.

352
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:44,507
That's how I intended to raise you.

353
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:19,015
You two,

354
00:48:20,653 --> 00:48:24,345
...are connected through a powerful force.

355
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:32,187
Your mother and I...

356
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:37,962
...are connected to you with the same force.

357
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:54,751
Dad?

358
00:49:37,963 --> 00:49:43,367
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

359
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:49,570
How I wonder what you are.

360
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:59,206
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

361
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:06,114
How I wonder what you are.

362
00:51:09,688 --> 00:51:14,086
I want to become Satoshi's little bride.

363
00:53:24,456 --> 00:53:28,092
Aqua plants shop, "Trash".

364
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:40,402
Is this your shop?

365
00:53:43,008 --> 00:53:45,442
Are you the owner?

366
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:50,671
Yes, I am.

367
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:03,160
I met your father...

368
00:54:04,263 --> 00:54:06,663
...in my dream.

369
00:54:12,404 --> 00:54:14,895
Satoshi is waiting,

370
00:54:15,741 --> 00:54:18,500
so go back for him, he said.

371
00:54:19,478 --> 00:54:22,578
He told me how to get back.

372
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:32,585
When I was about to leave, your father said...

373
00:54:35,327 --> 00:54:37,795
...he was happy,

374
00:54:44,636 --> 00:54:51,301
and that he loved you.

375
00:54:58,183 --> 00:55:08,210
"Karin, I'm sure you will see Satoshi again."

376
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:17,299
"When you see him...

377
00:55:19,605 --> 00:55:23,768
...Say hello for me," he said.

378
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:21,328
Welcome back, Karin.

379
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:28,266
I'm back.

Still burns into my heart, I can't forget about you

394
00:58:40,672 --> 00:58:45,438
As I wake up, still sleepless

395
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:51,341
I hear the crying of a baby for his mother

396
00:58:52,317 --> 00:59:02,680
I used to desire the same way in the past.

397
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:10,159
Do I hate the person who gave birth to me into this world?

398

Who created this world?

399
00:59:18,577 --> 00:59:21,307
Don't hate anyone,

400
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:24,177
Just laugh it off,

401
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:30,013
Even when something really sad happens

402

You can pile it up as a sweet memory
