She told me to hurry and go back.

I said let's go back together,

12
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,453
but Karin shook her head and said it was impossible.

This is an additive for accelerating aqua plant growth.

49
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,040
These plants withered because you put in too much fish food,

50
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,676
and the ecosystem became unbalanced.

Yes.

53
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,188
Leftover fish food and her bodily wastes must have polluted the water.

54
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,896
Because of that, the fragile balance inside the water tank fell apart,

55
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,296
and these aqua plants withered.

00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,901
What about this?

173
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,410
That's Microsorium Narrow Leaf.

174
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,482
This one is Echinodorus Angustifolius,

175
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,245
and this is Willow Moss.

176
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,985
I designed this with the image of a forest.

177
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,068
It's kind of mysterious, isn't it?

178
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:32,887
Hey,

179
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,723
what are these?

180
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,301
They're seeds of water lily.

181
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,030
Some of them stay asleep for up to 50 years.

182
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,905
Stay asleep?

183
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:51,312
But sometimes, it suddenly sprouts up after 50 years.

184
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,252
I hope it wakes up while I'm alive.

185
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,811
This place is really relaxing.

186
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,693
If you'd like, you can sleep upstairs.

187
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,189
I can sleep here.

188
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,829
No.

189
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,535
Hurry and get out of my room.

190
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,176
This is my shop...

191
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,425
Uh, no...

192
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,615
Good night.

193
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,822
... Morikawa.

194
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,718
Morikawa.

195
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,826
Morikawa!

196
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,101
Are you all right?
You were crying out in your sleep.

197
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,809
This will wake you up.

198
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,701
Want sugar and milk?

199
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,012
No, thanks.

200
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,228
It's all fine now, the water is clean.

201
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,641
I'm relieved.

202
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,638
How I wonder what you are.

203
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,215
[ Humming ]

204
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,258
Here.

205
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,306
As a thanks for always coming to help.

206
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,435
Thanks.

207
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,342
Chocolate danish! Looks good!

208
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,873
Tooyama loves it.

209
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,912
Thank you.

210
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,849
Listen,

211
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,054
why don't the three of us have a dinner tonight?

212
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,146
Huh?

213
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:23,824
All right?

214
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,299
You can eat it.

215
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,037
"Tooyama loves it."
( Can also mean "I love Tooyama" depending on context )

216
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,104
I only need one.

217
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,344
You' really are oblivious!

218
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,753
Remember this, there's a meaning behind everything a woman does.

219
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,824
You don't pay attention

220
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,756
to her gaze or signs she's sending you.

221
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,323
Huh? What are you talking about?

222
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,211
Why?

223
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,116
Why don't you notice?!

224
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,152
Watch out, watch out!

225
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,414
Watch out, watch out!

226
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,867
Good evening.

227
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,302
Good evening.

228
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,041
Where's Suzune?

229
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,810
Cancelled last minute...

230
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,534
She sleeps in the shop at night?

231
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,363
Yes, she doesn't have anywhere else to stay.

232
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,874
Doesn't that excite you?

233
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,674
Am I really that oblivious...

234
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,931
Congratulations!

235
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,305
This is from us.

236

Thanks!

237
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,654
It's a water tank!

238
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,121
Do you like it?

239
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,052
Yes. Thanks,

Welcome back.

Karin...

244
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,799
has never seen the faces of her parents.

245
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,879
I see...

246
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,546
I think that's why it made her feel lonely.

247
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,889
I'm back.

248
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,856

Satoshi found it from a broken binocular.

259
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,913
Yuuji said you like shiny stuff like this.

260
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,477
It's a prism.

261
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,820
It's a mirror that bends light.

262

You just realized that?

I have a pride too, you know.

You didn't remember me at all!

Because...

...you've really changed.

321

You haven't changed at all.

You didn't see him either?

Out of contact ever since leaving that town.

00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,735
I wonder where he is now.

329

I wonder if he's still drawing.

You can. I guarantee it.

Right.

I don't have any dreams.

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,607
...model for the artist,
and mascot girl for the aqua plants shop.

345
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,165
She's not here...

346
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,262
Ow!

347
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,630
Well, that's a surprise.

348
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,837
I'm surprised too.

349
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,275
No,

350
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,742
I'm surprised that you didn't recognize your childhood friend for so long!

351
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,583
He's been like this forever.

352
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,155
Shut up!

353
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:38,155
I can quit any time, now that Karin's in Trash.

354
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,187
What? You're quitting?

355
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,991
That's if I pass the accountant certification exam.

356
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,466
I'm thinking of succeeding my father's firm.

357
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,870
Really?

358
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,639
So, please stay here forever!

359
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,072
Oh, right. We have to find a place for her.

360
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,009
Huh?

361
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,480
You can't be sleeping in the shop's sofa forever.

362
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,879
He's right.

363
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,098
I wonder why she retired.

364
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,829
She said the diet was too tough.

365
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,175
Do you think that's the only reason?

366
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:35,340
I mean, she was just about to become a famous actress.

367
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,301
Satoshi!

368
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,151
Hurry.

369
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,005
What do you want to eat?

370
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,272
Curry!

371
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,214
Curry?

372
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,646
Curry, huh?

373
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,266
I found it!

374
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,579
Let's go.

375
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,328
Are you all right?

376
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:02,996
Yay!

377
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,324
Thanks.

378
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,454
Let's eat.

379
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,191
Hmm! It's delicious.

380
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,949
Ta-da!

381
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,654
I think this is a nice room.

382
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,521
What do you think?

383
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,556
Yes...

384
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,056
It's close to the shop too.

385
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,402
Listen, Satoshi...

386
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,145
Maybe this one is better?

387
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,414
That's not what I meant.

388
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,983
What is it?

389
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,022
Never mind.

390
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,300
[Medical Examination Room]

391
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,754
I wonder if Karin's all right.

392
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,489
Hey, Satoshi.

393
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,657
What?

394
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,894
What do you think of Karin?

395
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,096
What do you mean?

396
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,870
Don't you love her?

397
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:57,666
Huh?

398
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,670
But...

399
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,712
she has a bad mouth, and she's like a boy.

400
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,111
Don't you think?

401
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,744
I love her.

402
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,723
Are you all right?

403
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,956
Don't worry, just a minor anemia.

404
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,768
Karin?

405
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,269
It has been a long time.

406
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,345
I'm glad you came!

407
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,444
Come on in.

408
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,149
Well...

409
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,426
I don't mean to defend my own son, but

410
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,286
she became so beautiful, it's impossible to recognize her.

411
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,492
See?

412
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,427
It's nothing to brag about.

413
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,099
But you were beautiful back then too.

414
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,500
It wasn't something you could hide simply by dressing like a boy.

415
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,807
You must be happy to see her again.

416
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,912
He locked himself in his room after we moved.

417
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,547
- "I wanna see Karin!"
- Let's not talk about that!

418
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,419
What? What is it?

419
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:24,619
Come on, tell me!

420
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:25,752
It's nothing.

421
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:02,094
I'm sure his mom wanted to see you too.

422
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,828
It's been 13 years...

423
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,570
I wish I could turn back time.

424
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:28,078
I wish I can relive the time I spent in that town over and over again.

425
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,195
Karin.

426
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,253
It's the most powerful medicine.

427
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:06,216
This one stopped working for me too.

428
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,999
It wasn't cured?

429
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,934
I don't think I have much time left.

430
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,880
I keep falling deeper into sleep.

431
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,256
I'm afraid the next time I fall asleep...

432
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,824
...I'll never wake up again.

433
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,465
Karin...

434
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,610
I'm really glad you came!

435
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,418
Thank you.

436
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:20,364
Please don't tell Satoshi.

437
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,970
We haven't seen each other for 13 years.

438
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,173
So...

439
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:41,290
I intend to tell him I'm going somewhere far away.

440
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,631
Karin...

441
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,069
I'm...

442
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,738
...scared.

443
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,483
Scared of dying.

444
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,599
Please don't tell Satoshi.

445
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,869
Okay, I promise.

446
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,736
I'll write you a recommendation.

447
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,339
Have it looked at a bigger hospital.

448
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,713
Don't worry. I'm sure it'll get better.

449
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,155
I'm back.

450
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,488
Welcome back.

451
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,956
Where's Karin?

452
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,231
She said she's going out for a while.

453
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,290
Hello, this is Trash.

454
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,696
Yes.

455
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:06,665
Yes.

456
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:08,466
Boss,

457
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,969
someone named Katsuragi wants to speak with you.

458
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:11,938
Okay.

459
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,600
Please help her.

460
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,699
10 Rotala Indica.

461
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:15,909
Got it.

462
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,771
Hello.

463
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,281
Are you Mr. Tooyama Satoshi?

464
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,810
Yes, it is.

465
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,487
My name is Katsuragi Momoka.

466
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,456
I'm Igarashi Yuuji's friend.

467
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:29,988
What?

468
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,189
Then, you're Tooyama's childhood friend?

469
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:42,194
I just wanted to see if he's doing all right.

470
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,501
As a childhood friend?

471
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:51,644
Satoshi has been like that since he was little.

472
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:56,046
Really oblivious and hard to get along,

473
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,117
he's the kind of person who can't adapt to the society.

474
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,715
You know, he's not interested in anything other than aqua plants.

475
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,029
He seems so happy...

476
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,329
What?

477
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:15,363
When he talks about aqua plants.

478
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:16,961
Oh.

479
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,376
Don't you think so?

480
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:36,881
It takes time for Satoshi to get used to other people,

481
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:41,064
but the truth is, he just thinks too much about others,

482
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,227
a kind person.

483
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,541
Please,

484
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,111
look after Satoshi for me.
