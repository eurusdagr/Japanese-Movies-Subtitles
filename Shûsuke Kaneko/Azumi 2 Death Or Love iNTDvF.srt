"uploaded by Hrsh - Substar"

1
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,541
They've increased in number

2
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:17,542
Five from the west
Five from the south

3
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,695
Who the hell are
these persistent guys?

4
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:26,246
We're assassins who've
killed many people

5
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,969
It's obvious
that we're marked

6
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,144
That's true

7
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,912
Let's go!

8
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,532
They're coming...

9
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,526
You're rats
caught in our fangs

10
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,004
Prepare yourselves

11
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,593
Kill them!

12
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,912
Huh...!?

13
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,868
I'm sure I sliced him

14
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,973
- Let's fall back for now!
- Don't lose them!

15
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,507
These guys are
wearing steel armour

16
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:10,147
Is that Kanbei?

17
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,723
I'll get revenge
for Lord Kato

18
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:21,663
Shoot them!

19
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,781
- Damn!
- They jumped off

20
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,180
We lost them

21
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,384
They couldn't be unharmed
from this height

22
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,999
You still don't
know them well

23
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,294
Azumi

24
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,323
Let go of my hand!

25
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,312
Everyone died...

26
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,125
Now it's just
the two of us left

27
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:17,495
We have to kill Sanada
and complete the mission

28
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,762
You can't die a meaningless death
in a place like this

29
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,362
I'm going

30
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,037
Azumi 2

31
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:39,642
Death or Love

32
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,488
Kanbei, why have you
come such a long way?

33
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:04,102
Lord Kato
whom I served...

34
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,925
...fell victim
to assassins

35
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:11,872
Their last target
is you, Sir

36
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:14,885
The only one who may wield
the power of the Toyotomi...

37
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,893
...is you, Sir

38
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,832
I travelled this far...

39
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:23,978
...to ask what
you intend to do

40
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,444
- My intentions...
- Yes, Sir

41
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,593
You want to
know my intentions?

42
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:44,584
When Kato fell
right before your eyes...

43
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,340
...what the hell
did you do?

44
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,581
This pain...

45
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:56,467
...is Kato's price

46
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,586
It is my
suffering as well

47
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:05,393
Endure the suffering

48
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:10,643
Then you will naturally
know my intentions

49
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:13,682
If you do not...

50
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:20,473
...explain your intentions
to this lowly servant...

51
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,862
How could he fathom
the deeper meaning?

52
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,445
I was driven out
by the Tokugawa

53
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:36,735
For 10 years since the
attack at Kudo mountain...

54
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:43,454
...I have never lost in
a battle against the Tokugawa!

55
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:48,644
But... the war between
the Tokugawa and the Toyotomi...

56
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,357
...is not over

57
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:56,031
The Toyotomi's defeat
is imminent

58
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,238
Wasn't it you
who said...

59
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,678
...that in a war with
no chance for victory...

60
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:05,283
...you couldn't let
your followers die, Father?

61
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:11,019
Even my son
doubts my strength

62
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:17,902
You are deluded
by something, Father

63
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,493
The Uenokogashu's ninja,
Kunio

64
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,587
The girl called
the demon of war

65
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:42,129
Young Master Yukimura
is unsatisfied with us

66
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:46,516
I just don't
want a hopeless war

67
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,362
What are your personal reasons
for assisting Father?

68
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:52,303
Watch your words,
Yukimura!

69
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:59,034
Kunio
You're really something

70
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:08,281
If those are truly
your intentions...

71
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,662
...then I will go
right now to Osaka...

72
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:16,218
...and consult the
opinion of the Toyotomi

73
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,287
Well then

74
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:36,004
Nagara, are you all right?

75
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:38,842
Ouch!

76
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,829
Get a hold of yourself

77
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:11,248
This is where Master
waited for secret messengers

78
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,775
If we wait,
someone will come for sure

79
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,324
Good job, Azumi!

80
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:17,628
Azumi

81
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,931
Azumi

82
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,292
Nachi

83
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:39,072
Nachi, watch

84
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:46,536
You're doing well
You've really become strong

85
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:47,651
Azumi

86
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,499
There's something
I really wanted to say

87
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:02,026
I really like you

88
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,144
The mission
ahead of you...

89
00:13:08,757 --> 00:13:10,797
...will be
infinitely brutal

90
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,908
You must harden yourself
with a steel resolve

91
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,790
That is the
path of an assassin

92
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:21,744
The partner you
are matched with...

93
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:26,769
Azumi

94
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,991
Kill him!

95
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,823
I want to
complete the mission

96
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:52,126
Nachi

97
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,500
Azumi

98
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,672
This is
our destiny

99
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,670
Nachi...

100
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,605
No!

101
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,970
What's the matter?

102
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:31,206
I'm hungry
I'll go get something to eat

103
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:36,170
You're invulnerable

104
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:41,803
- Azumi
- Yeah?

105
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,425
Thanks

106
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:16,152
Please give me
something to eat

107
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,740
- OK, here you go
- Thank you

108
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,435
Your change

109
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,170
Nobody move!

110
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:36,311
D~don't misunderstand

111
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:39,648
We're noble robbers
who help others

112
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,145
We work for the
sake of the world

113
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:46,204
If you want to do something good,
you have to be alive first

114
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,399
So let's all
get along and share

115
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,260
We need
your help

116
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,197
Give us
all your money

117
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:58,338
Don't hesitate
Hurry up and fork it over

118
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,637
Give it up

119
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,850
You too

120
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,866
I don't have any money to give
to a bandit the likes of you

121
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,236
Then why don't you
leave your sword

122
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,723
You won't have another occasion
to use it anyway

123
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,273
You insolent fool

124
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,057
Put out your worries and
just hand over your money

125
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,809
Hurry up and fork it over

126
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,604
- Where are you going?
- Please move aside

127
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,740
It's a girl
with a lot of guts

128
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,964
She's cute

129
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:59,417
Such a pretty face

130
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,454
- Ginkaku
- Yeah?

131
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,762
What are you doing?

132
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:09,306
Ginkaku,
take a look...

133
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,194
Nachi?!

134
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,736
What do you think? Pretty, right?
Let's take her with us

135
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:19,480
You agreed to work for
the sake of the world

136
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,436
If we had a girl...

137
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,629
...she couldn't become one of us

138
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:33,347
W~well,
how about an assistant?

139
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,858
- Hey hey hey
- Stop it

140
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:57,289
Son of a bitch, the effect of
your blood was awesome!

141
00:17:57,486 --> 00:17:59,460
Fooled them all in an instant

142
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,232
Man, you really
looked like a warrior

143
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,321
K~Ginkaku

144
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,653
Why did you drive away
a hot girl like that?

145
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:19,311
- That girl is strong
- What?

146
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:21,516
Clumsy awkward guys like us
would take the fall

147
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:25,517
- R~really?
- Yeah

148
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,789
Azumi, stop!
They're on our side

149
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,389
I am Hanjo of Iga

150
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:13,143
We came because
Lord Tenkai sent us

151
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,606
I heard many
rumours about you

152
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,432
They were incredible

153
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,074
Asano Nagamasa
Kato Kiyamasa

154
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:31,970
Thanks to you
killing those two...

155
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:36,902
We were able to
avoid a blameless war

156
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:40,874
You fulfilled your
mission successfully

157
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,234
That is sufficient

158
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:46,405
There is still one man left

159
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:48,998
Sanada Masayuki

160
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,420
We are too inadequate
to take Sanada down

161
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:54,120
Pardon?

162
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:57,549
He has hired
a killer ninja squad

163
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,754
They're called
the Uenokogashu

164
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:03,377
They're a gruesome bunch that
don't belong to any ninja school...

165
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,994
...who make assassination
their business

166
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:10,736
We may even have to
mobilize the army

167
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,737
We're here so that
we can avoid a war

168
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,029
We will deal with
Sanada Masayuki

169
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:27,512
As our master commanded,
we will complete the mission

170
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:31,801
We will finish it for sure
for the sake of our fallen comrades

171
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:37,845
You will not
come back alive

172
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:44,123
Master commanded us to
kill our own comrades

173
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:49,815
For the sake of making me
a cool-headed assassin...

174
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,391
I killed my partner who was like
a brother to me with my own hand

175
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,746
I don't have any expectations
of coming back alive

176
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,549
Fine

177
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,389
Complete the mission

178
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,527
I want to go too

179
00:21:23,755 --> 00:21:26,276
Allow me to guide you through
the lay of Kudo mountain

180
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,568
Hanjo sent spies
to Kudo mountain

181
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:37,550
They're watching
Sanada's every move

182
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,007
The movements of Tenkai
who regulates the Tokugawa...

183
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,042
...from behind the scenes
are suspicious

184
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,993
The pigeons
are crying out

185
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,186
The assassins
of the Tokugawa...

186
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,692
...came to cut the head
off this old man

187
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,214
You smell
like blood

188
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:25,383
Isn't it your
favourite scent?

189
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:35,567
When I was young...

190
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:38,668
...this was
my happiest moment

191
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,741
And now?

192
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:44,564
With this old body...

193
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,763
...what craving
could be left...

194
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:52,053
...except to
verify that I...

195
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,604
...still have the strength to live

196
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:05,075
The day those who make
attempts at your life...

197
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:08,244
...fall into the hands
of our ninjas...

198
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,071
We've come to a major road

199
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:26,332
Gozue is
really excited

200
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:30,843
Let's go
What are you doing?

201
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:39,197
What's the matter?

202
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:47,490
I met a guy who looked
just like Nachi

203
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,409
Nachi?

204
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,130
He's a bandit who goes
by the name Ginkaku

205
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:12,910
Hey!
You want a fight?

206
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,763
What did you say?

207
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,019
- Sorry!
- You assholes

208
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:22,133
How pathetic, running away

209
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,752
If we catch you one more time
you're dead

210
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,568
You have all gathered below
the banner of General Sanada

211
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:47,991
You're a sad
lonely lot...

212
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,765
...who don't
have homes...

213
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:54,004
...or family
to lean on

214
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,725
But there's
no need to worry

215
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:01,076
Starting today,
you are servants of General Sanada

216
00:26:01,312 --> 00:26:04,412
Hold up the banner of
General Sanada and follow him

217
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,969
You will kill the assassins
who seek the life...

218
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:11,201
...of our ever vigilant Lord
and fight the Tokugawa

219
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:15,202
If you do that,
then the Lord Sanada Masayuki...

220
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,650
...will grant
you a reward

221
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,630
Wow~!

222
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,574
Those who want to become
a soldier for General Sanada...

223
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,033
...come to this side

224
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,597
Yeah!

225
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,309
- K~Ginkaku
- Ginkaku

226
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:45,961
Pick out the
skilled ones

227
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:48,262
Yes, Sir!

228
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,449
What do you think
those assassins are like?

229
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,033
You're really going to
become a soldier for Sanada?

230
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,754
I took the money

231
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:07,277
All we have to do is
kill the assassins, right?

232
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,182
I don't like
slicing people with swords

233
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:16,143
Ginkaku will
take care of it, right?

234
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:20,022
Who's the guy who went on about
how he killed 100 people?

235
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:21,559
When did I?

236
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:25,366
If you don't want to
then we can just run away

237
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,227
B~but you know,
that girl from before...

238
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:44,350
If I keep thinking about her
as I look at the stars...

239
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,972
I'll meet her again, right?

240
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,087
- Hey man
- What?

241
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:51,421
Want to meet her?
I'm talking about that girl

242
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:53,944
You're the one who really wants
to meet her, right?

243
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:55,966
Me?

244
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:15,072
Maybe it's because of the war
but the atmosphere is really dreary

245
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:32,491
- Ginkaku
- Nachi?!

246
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,533
Are they the assassins who are trying
to claim Sanada's life?

247
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,964
There's no mistake

248
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:39,182
What should we do?

249
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,445
Hold on a moment

250
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:44,716
Don't get in the way
Attack!

251
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,288
What are you doing?

252
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,164
Didn't you hear me
tell you to wait?

253
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,886
I changed my mind
These guys are the enemy

254
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:02,578
Huh?

255
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,577
All right!
Do as your told

256
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:11,090
Kill them!

257
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,470
Traitor!

258
00:29:57,737 --> 00:30:00,737
You can't trust
anything in this world

259
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:08,777
Run

260
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:31,571
Are you
a demon?

261
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:54,996
You bastard...

262
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:45,933
Hey everybody,
Big Brother's back!

263
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,362
Ginkaku

264
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:50,733
Have you all been well?

265
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,160
These are children who lost
their parents because of the war

266
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,200
I brought
them here

267
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,217
You've grown a lot

268
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,903
This guy's gotten fat

269
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:11,274
Don't cry
Come over here

270
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,102
You're good right? Don't cry

271
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:31,257
Want to play with Big Brother?
Let's play

272
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:39,582
- Saburo
- Yeah?

273
00:34:39,582 --> 00:34:42,038
- How about elder brother?
- He died

274
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:49,018
Ginkaku,
who's this?

275
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,971
These are my friends

276
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:56,030
These gentle people
are your friends?

277
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:59,327
They may look like that
but they're assassins

278
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,073
They kill people
without even blinking

279
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,585
Is that true?

280
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:12,194
With a pretty face like this,
you commit murder?

281
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:15,750
We kill the people
who start the war

282
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:17,701
The war
won't go away

283
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:20,515
As long as people are here,
it will continue

284
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,396
The people who get
used as tools...

285
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,439
...are the most foolish

286
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,228
Are you saying
that to us?

287
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,472
Nagara

288
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:32,872
Be patient

289
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:34,255
You heard him just now

290
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:35,912
This bastard didn't
just insult us...

291
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:38,953
...he insulted our
fallen comrades as well

292
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:42,056
I'm sorry if I was disagreeable

293
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:45,611
Ginkaku

294
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:49,770
Give me the money you raised

295
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:59,085
You didn't do
anything bad, right?

296
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:03,542
Chiyo, there's no
good or bad with money

297
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:06,133
If a good person spends it,
then it's good money

298
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:08,855
- Grandma Yone
- What?

299
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:10,392
Look at this
There's so much

300
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,483
You were up to no good again
You won't die in peace

301
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:17,524
If you are healthy
and eat well...

302
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:21,813
...and if the children grow up well,
that's enough for me

303
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:40,825
Chiyo, leave him be
He'll sleep when he gets worn out

304
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,441
Chiyo, I'll help

305
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,582
That's fine

306
00:37:01,064 --> 00:37:03,455
Please just sleep
and leave quickly

307
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,250
Did we do
something wrong?

308
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:15,076
Assassins who kill people
are abominable

309
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:23,658
What's the use of
cultivating love and devotion?

310
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:28,268
It's obvious that we'll just
fall victim to people like you

311
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:33,514
We want to
get rid of the war

312
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:36,681
So there won't be
children with no parents

313
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:40,363
You chat well
for a murderer

314
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,168
What about the children
of the people you killed?

315
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,679
That's...

316
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:56,276
Gozue, get up

317
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:58,544
Azumi, let's go

318
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,203
We live in a different world
than these people

319
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,895
Nagara

320
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,185
The enemy is at
their base

321
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:12,272
We're finally moving out

322
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:15,726
If Lord Sanada
attacks Tenkai...

323
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,385
...then the feudal lords siding
with the Toyotomi will be furious

324
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:24,560
If we get wrapped up in
a violent battle again...

325
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,860
War would probably
break out again

326
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,518
While Young Master Yukimura
is gone...

327
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:31,693
...this is the time
to make our move

328
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:36,183
The Black Spider
is getting amused

329
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:40,791
The Black Spider
will be the opponent...

330
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:44,118
...of the assassins
aiming for the Lord's life

331
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,289
You are strong

332
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,810
One of their spies
is on our side

333
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:55,807
Don't leave out a single person
Annihilate everyone

334
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,458
Show them clearly
the strength of the Uenokogashu

335
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:27,397
It's Sanada's soldiers

336
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,785
Who are they?

337
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:32,962
It must be a war

338
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,467
Let's go

339
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:43,690
Can I ask
one question?

340
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,254
Yeah?

341
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:48,109
What's the secret
to dodging arrows?

342
00:40:48,206 --> 00:40:49,220
What?

343
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:52,522
Both of you have
never been hit by an arrow

344
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:57,129
Let the master of running
teach you something

345
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:00,175
Take an arrow
and stand here

346
00:41:02,898 --> 00:41:08,530
One two three...
Eight up to here

347
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:11,215
In my experience,
it's eight steps

348
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:16,175
If you have this much distance,
you can dodge them

349
00:41:16,342 --> 00:41:17,838
Azumi
only needs six

350
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:19,415
All right, try shooting me

351
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:23,086
From here?
Shoot for real?

352
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:25,075
Don't worry
Just shoot me

353
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:05,666
Wow! You're amazing

354
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,736
Arrows are surprisingly slow

355
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,652
If the distance is enough,
you can dodge them

356
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:14,791
- Let's go
- Sure

357
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:18,564
There's none left

358
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:27,146
What you see over there
is Kudo mountain

359
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,400
That's where
Sanada Masayuki is

360
00:42:31,918 --> 00:42:33,705
We've arrived at our destination

361
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:55,213
Nagara...
You like Azumi, right?

362
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:56,596
What?!

363
00:42:57,014 --> 00:42:59,734
Has anything happened while the
two of you have always been together?

364
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:03,439
Azumi is just like
a little sister to me

365
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:07,126
You really don't have
any feelings for her?

366
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,587
Well, I like her

367
00:43:14,332 --> 00:43:17,627
Our fallen comrades
liked Azumi too

368
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:22,547
That's why I'm going to
protect her in their stead

369
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:31,612
It looks like she
likes that Ginkaku guy

370
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:41,924
Azumi's true intentions
are probably...

371
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:43,997
...to disappear to somewhere
far away with Ginkaku

372
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:46,303
It can't be

373
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:51,200
You saw it too,
haven't you?

374
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:56,230
Actually, that guy...

375
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,421
...looks exactly
like Nachi who died

376
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:04,413
That Nachi guy...

377
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:07,494
Did Azumi
like him?

378
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:15,051
Let's send Azumi
to Ginkaku

379
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:18,575
To us, the mission...

380
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,035
If you really want
to protect Azumi...

381
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:23,340
...then let her get away
from a dangerous mission

382
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:33,361
Let's kill Sanada
ourselves

383
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:49,107
Ginkaku

384
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:52,504
Sanada left
Kudo mountain

385
00:44:53,146 --> 00:44:54,039
What?

386
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:56,819
Now Kudo mountain
is just an empty shell

387
00:44:57,082 --> 00:44:58,130
Scrap

388
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:03,282
I'll have to verify
with my own eyes

389
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,110
Trust us

390
00:45:07,677 --> 00:45:10,066
Is the mission
that important?

391
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,551
You stay out of this

392
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,790
Did someone say they'd recognize you
for risking your life to fight?

393
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,034
That's right

394
00:45:20,353 --> 00:45:22,050
In any case,
the war won't go away

395
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,611
That's right!

396
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:25,722
More than that...

397
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:30,235
...why don't we think about
a way to live happily?

398
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,315
Just like Chiyo

399
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:36,444
What do you think about
living with the children?

400
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:39,457
Let's do that, Azumi

401
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:51,296
I want to do that but...

402
00:45:54,475 --> 00:45:56,002
I can't

403
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:00,868
- Why? Why can't you?
- Wait

404
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:02,852
Come on everyone, persuade her

405
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,096
Azumi,
hold on!

406
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,439
Azumi!

407
00:46:08,784 --> 00:46:10,212
There's no reason you can't

408
00:46:15,218 --> 00:46:17,040
Follow Ginkaku

409
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:21,196
Why are you even doing this?

410
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,627
Mission?
Don't make me laugh

411
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:30,294
Gozue and I are
going on a vacation

412
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:34,445
Listen up, I'm sick of
following the mission

413
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:39,316
I've endured it up to now
but I finally understand

414
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,221
In a vain ideal,
we lost our comrades

415
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:46,101
I felt the attacks of our enemies
as we stood before them

416
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:49,200
There wasn't a single day
when my mind was at ease

417
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:52,149
Do you really mean that?

418
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,136
Of course I mean it

419
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:58,012
You should live happily
with Ginkaku too

420
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,360
Forget about
completing the mission

421
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,879
Nagara, get a grip
Why are you doing this?

422
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:04,375
You get a grip!

423
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:07,862
I'm finished living
for the sake of the mission

424
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:10,487
We're leaving

425
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:13,730
Take care

426
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:20,226
Please, I'm begging you
Don't do this

427
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:23,323
Ginkaku,
take care of Azumi

428
00:47:23,655 --> 00:47:28,096
And don't show up
in front of me again

429
00:47:30,952 --> 00:47:32,416
Nagara, wait!

430
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,929
He's right

431
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:41,478
Look at us

432
00:47:43,054 --> 00:47:44,646
Though we don't have anything...

433
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:48,005
...we live with
freedom and happiness

434
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:51,051
- Isn't that true?
- Yup

435
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:01,161
I...

436
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:07,188
I'm different from you guys

437
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,229
Everything I've seen,
touched, and perceived

438
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,807
So don't interfere

439
00:48:18,136 --> 00:48:19,696
We're not interfering!

440
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,007
- Right?
- That's right

441
00:48:21,176 --> 00:48:22,190
- Right?
- That's right

442
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,855
- Right?
- That's right

443
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:32,944
D~don't go

444
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,548
What are you doing
not trying to stop her?

445
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:36,989
Don't go,
Azumi!

446
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,298
Live with us

447
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,811
It's for the best

448
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:49,372
If it's Ginkaku,
you can relax

449
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:52,857
Azumi will be
happy now too

450
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:57,601
If Ginkaku's words
are right...

451
00:48:58,884 --> 00:49:01,569
...then Sanada has
already left Kudo mountain

452
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:06,239
After Azumi and the rest...

453
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,663
...have gone away...

454
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:13,478
...let's take this chance
and hit Sanada

455
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:17,025
Sure
Let's chase Sanada

456
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:19,143
I know
all the roads

457
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,690
- Is this the right way?
- There's no mistaking it

458
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:31,266
We've been going in circles

459
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,096
If we go a little more,
there'll be a major road

460
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,334
Then let's hurry

461
00:49:52,498 --> 00:49:53,962
Nagara

462
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:13,172
What the hell is this?

463
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:19,668
Did you say to shoot
within eight steps?

464
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,644
You taught me

465
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:25,273
Gozue, you...

466
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,663
We're on the same side

467
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,501
I'm the spy the
Uenokogashu sent

468
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,785
I trained under ninja
ever since I was young

469
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,151
I built up trust...

470
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:44,542
...and waited only
for a day like this

471
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:49,341
Burying Tenkai's gang...

472
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:55,589
...is my first
priority mission

473
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,630
Mission?

474
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:07,525
Don't be careless
and try to pretend

475
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,637
Dammit!
This can't be happening

476
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,210
Azumi

477
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:11,927
Let Azumi...

478
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:15,798
...live

479
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,477
Azumi~!

480
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:29,668
Of all times, why do people
come to interfere now?

481
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,137
Next time, I will definitely
cut your throat

482
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,881
I told you that
Sanada isn't here

483
00:54:51,951 --> 00:54:54,854
He already left
with his soldiers

484
00:54:56,432 --> 00:54:57,994
It can't be

485
00:54:59,057 --> 00:55:01,295
He isn't intending to
attack Lord Tenkai, is he?

486
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:04,200
Their target is you,
Lord Tenkai

487
00:55:07,028 --> 00:55:12,212
Are you saying that Sanada
has left Kudo mountain?

488
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:14,291
We have received word

489
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:17,036
We do not have
a moment to lose

490
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:22,227
If we flee from here...

491
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,206
...we have to
abandon Azumi's party

492
00:55:25,979 --> 00:55:29,940
We don't have time to
take care of our assassins

493
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:35,251
I must protect you,
Lord Tenkai

494
00:55:36,572 --> 00:55:40,665
- You're telling me to throw them away
- Lord Tenkai

495
00:55:41,534 --> 00:55:44,022
Azumi is...

496
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,563
It can't be helped

497
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:58,041
I'll do what you say

498
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:03,836
I was right, wasn't I?

499
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:06,146
Sanada's henchmen are
spread out everywhere

500
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,515
There's a temple beyond
that mountain over there

501
00:56:09,862 --> 00:56:11,619
We're completely trapped in

502
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,912
It'll be hell from here on

503
00:56:15,784 --> 00:56:17,476
Hurry and go back you guys

504
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:22,277
A~are you worrying
about us right now?

505
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:25,824
We've already come this far
so let's go to the end

506
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,772
I like it!
Guys...

507
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,910
Let's go crazy for once

508
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,179
Kill anyone who comes close

509
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:40,522
The blood's gonna break out

510
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:42,251
Let's have a helluva fight

511
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:45,583
Your mouths are lively
so you can talk a lot

512
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:54,130
I had a friend
who was a lot like you

513
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:56,491
Was that guy
also an assassin?

514
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,204
Yeah
He was a guy named Nachi

515
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:01,965
Nachi...

516
00:57:03,862 --> 00:57:06,831
There are many people
who look similar

517
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,198
So what happened to him?

518
00:57:13,018 --> 00:57:14,481
He died

519
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,355
I... killed him

520
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:21,527
- What?
- Let's go

521
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,388
The ranks to the west
are in position

522
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:35,645
The ranks to the east
are in position

523
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,435
We have blockaded
the road to their base

524
00:57:42,243 --> 00:57:44,765
Tenkai is a cornered rat

525
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:48,027
They have no holes
to run away

526
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:50,942
Instead of wasting
precious soldiers...

527
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:55,421
...allow us handle this

528
00:57:55,686 --> 00:57:57,182
You must not lose him

529
00:57:57,831 --> 00:57:58,846
Yes, Sir!

530
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:17,099
Stop

531
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:24,550
You're one step behind

532
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:29,007
Uenokogashu!

533
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:32,652
Scatter!

534
00:58:51,384 --> 00:58:53,655
Lord Tenkai,
please escape

535
00:59:10,942 --> 00:59:13,047
This way

536
01:01:31,112 --> 01:01:32,838
Sir Hanjo!

537
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:47,364
Take care

538
01:02:14,386 --> 01:02:15,495
Azumi!

539
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:34,347
Itkaku!

540
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,027
You assholes!

541
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:44,695
Boss!

542
01:02:45,339 --> 01:02:46,268
Die!

543
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:00,246
Kijimaru!

544
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:06,555
Move aside

545
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:33,099
Everyone is dead

546
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,924
Ginkaku

547
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:46,253
Thanks for looking out for
this dim-witted big brother

548
01:04:49,904 --> 01:04:51,498
Don't say that

549
01:05:03,507 --> 01:05:05,331
Azumi...

550
01:05:26,683 --> 01:05:28,410
I feel good

551
01:05:31,998 --> 01:05:33,428
K~Ginkaku

552
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:45,819
Bro!

553
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:49,618
Open your eyes

554
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:53,571
Boss~!

555
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:33,667
- Mistress Kunio
- Why are you coming now?

556
01:06:34,252 --> 01:06:35,844
We lost them

557
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:38,799
What?!
What happened?

558
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,842
They're not average assassins

559
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:42,991
Rokpa also has fallen

560
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:44,929
Rokpa was beaten?

561
01:06:46,474 --> 01:06:51,433
The Matchless Rokpa?

562
01:06:52,336 --> 01:06:54,436
I can't believe it

563
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:57,992
We must bring them
into the spider web

564
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:02,060
Are you saying we should lure them?

565
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:06,819
If they get caught in a web
loaded with poison

566
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:12,076
Their bodies will become
paralysed and they won't budge

567
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,763
The slightest mistake and
you'll be in the same situation

568
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:16,939
Mistress Kunio,
please throw the bait

569
01:07:58,397 --> 01:08:01,266
These are the only
soldiers who survived

570
01:08:02,137 --> 01:08:03,798
This is too horrible

571
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,453
They all died trying
to protect you

572
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,044
You know that?!

573
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:11,934
- Ginkaku
- It's OK

574
01:08:13,562 --> 01:08:15,289
You're right

575
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,181
Gozue

576
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,313
Where's Nagara?

577
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:29,055
While fighting enemies
to protect me...

578
01:08:29,794 --> 01:08:32,988
...we got split up

579
01:08:37,258 --> 01:08:38,655
He'll be all right

580
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,234
He was the most agile
of all of us

581
01:08:44,201 --> 01:08:45,917
Surely...

582
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:55,425
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- I just...

583
01:08:57,065 --> 01:08:59,233
It's nothing

584
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,988
There is a shortcut to the
Tokugawa temple grounds

585
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:04,036
I'll guide you

586
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:23,694
Lord Tenkai,
please wait here for a moment

587
01:09:45,008 --> 01:09:47,829
Mission...
The mission...

588
01:09:58,263 --> 01:10:00,910
It was a mistake!
We're surrounded by enemies

589
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:02,772
What did you say?

590
01:10:19,836 --> 01:10:21,457
You bitch!

591
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:32,797
Gozue

592
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:39,868
Nagara...

593
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:47,376
Where's Nagara?

594
01:10:48,672 --> 01:10:50,714
The mission...

595
01:10:58,274 --> 01:11:00,605
I asked you
Where's Nagara?

596
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:04,127
I killed him

597
01:11:06,947 --> 01:11:08,741
What did you say?

598
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:14,044
To the end, he only pleaded
that I let you live

599
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:17,794
Of course that's a
promise I can't keep

600
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:21,411
Lies

601
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:31,264
I couldn't should you from here,
could I?

602
01:11:32,107 --> 01:11:33,452
Gozue

603
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,448
Tell me that's a lie

604
01:11:40,136 --> 01:11:41,632
That's...

605
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:46,792
...the mission I was given

606
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,997
Nagara is dead

607
01:12:38,515 --> 01:12:41,135
To think he'd fall
to someone like you

608
01:12:56,511 --> 01:12:58,361
Don't follow me!

609
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:01,998
I'll deal with Sanada

610
01:13:39,495 --> 01:13:41,569
Are you Azumi?

611
01:13:49,796 --> 01:13:53,893
I sent Gozue to hell already

612
01:13:55,428 --> 01:13:56,925
What?

613
01:13:58,057 --> 01:14:01,289
I also lost my only companion

614
01:14:05,414 --> 01:14:09,210
I'll tear you to shreds!

615
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:11,810
I'll repay you...

616
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:15,206
...for the words you just spoke

617
01:16:01,568 --> 01:16:02,940
Gotcha

618
01:17:57,946 --> 01:18:00,215
Has the poison spread?

619
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:07,602
You...
How dare you...

620
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:12,447
Rokpa and Gozue weren't enough
So even the Black Spider?

621
01:18:13,627 --> 01:18:16,669
You've dried up the seeds
of the Uenokogashu

622
01:18:30,078 --> 01:18:31,775
You insolent bitch!

623
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:38,203
What a man is...
What life is...

624
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:43,643
Even what the world is...
You're an inexperienced girl who knows none of these

625
01:19:09,197 --> 01:19:10,751
I can't forgive you

626
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,157
Has the poison spread?

627
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,803
This is the end

628
01:19:25,743 --> 01:19:28,429
Drop into hell for me

629
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,034
Prepare yourself!

630
01:20:01,044 --> 01:20:05,525
General...
Lord Sanada...

631
01:21:00,381 --> 01:21:01,494
Azumi

632
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:05,629
Are you all right?

633
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:10,166
Azumi

634
01:21:14,915 --> 01:21:16,777
Get a hold of yourself

635
01:21:49,062 --> 01:21:50,012
Azumi

636
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:52,545
Is the mission
that important?

637
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,472
I'm going to
complete the mission

638
01:21:54,799 --> 01:21:57,610
There are many people
who look similar

639
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:01,515
Isn't that true?

640
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,885
Nachi

641
01:22:09,621 --> 01:22:11,377
The mission...

642
01:22:17,965 --> 01:22:19,211
Nachi

643
01:22:21,523 --> 01:22:23,279
Nachi

644
01:22:24,086 --> 01:22:25,361
I...

645
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:31,760
- You know who I am, don't you?
- Nachi...

646
01:22:34,293 --> 01:22:35,923
Nachi

647
01:22:37,594 --> 01:22:39,416
It's OK

648
01:22:42,772 --> 01:22:45,044
The poison only
spread a little

649
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:05,364
You have to live

650
01:25:10,555 --> 01:25:12,272
Azumi...

651
01:25:15,635 --> 01:25:17,612
You can't die

652
01:25:30,842 --> 01:25:33,844
- Kunio
- General

653
01:25:35,321 --> 01:25:36,982
Mistress Kunio!

654
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,229
General

655
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:44,960
I couldn't kill the assassin

656
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,620
What do you mean?

657
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:51,580
How did you
get these wounds?

658
01:25:55,935 --> 01:25:57,691
Your dreams of war...

659
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:01,020
...cannot end here

660
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:06,389
Everything was for your sake

661
01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:13,432
I only wanted to see you smile

662
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:22,238
General

663
01:26:31,655 --> 01:26:37,881
Kunio
Kunio!

664
01:27:08,012 --> 01:27:09,901
Ginkaku?

665
01:27:22,188 --> 01:27:23,753
Ginkaku

666
01:27:26,735 --> 01:27:28,875
Wake up
Ginkaku!

667
01:28:10,269 --> 01:28:12,309
Why did you...

668
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:25,500
Instead of me...

669
01:28:31,524 --> 01:28:35,746
Why did you die
in place of me?

670
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:33,029
Why dammit, why?!

671
01:29:52,275 --> 01:29:54,506
The people I love around me...

672
01:29:57,616 --> 01:30:00,042
Why do they all die?

673
01:30:17,206 --> 01:30:18,261
Listen up

674
01:30:21,078 --> 01:30:23,830
This is an all out attack on Tenkai

675
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:26,939
Move out!

676
01:30:59,582 --> 01:31:02,749
And the prey comes
walking up to our feet

677
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:06,135
Get her!

678
01:33:00,313 --> 01:33:01,590
Prepare to fire!

679
01:33:29,311 --> 01:33:31,517
Call off the attack

680
01:33:33,245 --> 01:33:34,559
General!

681
01:33:34,559 --> 01:33:35,672
You must not!

682
01:33:36,957 --> 01:33:38,386
Get out of my way

683
01:33:42,695 --> 01:33:48,188
To think such a young girl
is an assassin

684
01:33:52,131 --> 01:33:54,683
What reason do you have
for seeking my life

685
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:56,996
It is to get rid of the war

686
01:33:57,542 --> 01:34:01,821
Nonsense!

687
01:34:07,462 --> 01:34:09,022
Yukimura

688
01:34:10,308 --> 01:34:12,036
Father!

689
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:20,679
Gather up the troops

690
01:34:20,746 --> 01:34:22,022
Not only the Toyotomi...

691
01:34:22,022 --> 01:34:25,351
...but now no one
is on our side

692
01:34:25,351 --> 01:34:27,941
This is not your place
to interfere!

693
01:34:28,143 --> 01:34:30,214
Go back to Kudo mountain

694
01:34:31,338 --> 01:34:34,279
There is no hope in
taking action like this

695
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:39,815
These are all the consequences
of my actions

696
01:34:40,266 --> 01:34:42,213
You be quiet

697
01:34:51,222 --> 01:34:53,361
Priest Tenkai

698
01:34:55,442 --> 01:34:57,746
General Sanada

699
01:34:59,156 --> 01:35:06,760
Do you intend to face
all of these soldiers

700
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:13,361
My defeat is imminent anyway

701
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:17,802
If we are to die here...

702
01:35:18,196 --> 01:35:21,457
...the Tokugawa will not sit tight

703
01:35:28,372 --> 01:35:32,017
If I let you live
the result will be the same

704
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:37,774
It is time to make a decisive decision

705
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:45,946
That despicable girl...

706
01:35:46,809 --> 01:35:49,535
...took away what I treasured most

707
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:56,017
Leave that young assassin and go

708
01:36:04,929 --> 01:36:11,865
Then I, Sanada Masayuki,
will return to Kudo mountain

709
01:36:12,163 --> 01:36:15,195
I will not resist
the Tokugawa again

710
01:36:33,218 --> 01:36:35,712
H~hold on

711
01:36:35,943 --> 01:36:38,975
You want us to leave Azumi?
No way

712
01:36:39,272 --> 01:36:40,797
No way...

713
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:25,996
I am an assassin

714
01:37:31,992 --> 01:37:34,703
I am always prepared to die

715
01:37:38,867 --> 01:37:41,391
All of my comrades...

716
01:37:42,647 --> 01:37:45,267
...died feeling the same

717
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:56,395
If you believe a
world of peace will come...

718
01:38:00,757 --> 01:38:03,961
Even if we were just used...

719
01:38:14,907 --> 01:38:16,913
Even if that's the case...

720
01:38:18,303 --> 01:38:20,568
Today will be the end of everything

721
01:38:26,425 --> 01:38:28,633
If I eliminate Sanada

722
01:38:31,712 --> 01:38:33,565
You will be hated

723
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:36,633
I willingly comply

724
01:38:36,864 --> 01:38:38,457
- General
- Stop!

725
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:40,768
- No one interfere
- Father

726
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:44,068
Even if you don't interfere
this is enough

727
01:38:44,317 --> 01:38:46,937
I brought this all
upon myself

728
01:38:56,096 --> 01:39:00,221
I will get revenge for Kunio

729
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:02,122
Prepare yourself

730
01:40:17,843 --> 01:40:19,311
Father~!

731
01:40:25,787 --> 01:40:29,433
Don't shoot
Lower your guns

732
01:40:30,267 --> 01:40:31,952
Stand back

733
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:40,789
You wench...

734
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:44,366
Kanbei
Sheathe your sword

735
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:46,525
She killed every one
of our most skilled warriors

736
01:40:46,525 --> 01:40:49,912
And she cut the
sprouts of the Toyotomi

737
01:40:51,513 --> 01:40:54,718
This was my father's
last wish

738
01:40:55,486 --> 01:41:00,405
I want to protect what
little honour remains

739
01:41:00,674 --> 01:41:03,963
Nobody interfere

740
01:41:05,469 --> 01:41:10,007
I must get revenge
for Lord Kato

741
01:41:10,977 --> 01:41:14,526
How could I not
know your rage?

742
01:41:16,358 --> 01:41:19,880
However, the promise of a warrior...

743
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,387
...must be kept even
at the risk of life

744
01:42:05,097 --> 01:42:08,234
Do you think the war
has really ended?

745
01:42:08,847 --> 01:42:11,851
The mission is over

746
01:42:12,561 --> 01:42:15,906
Our affiliation is only
up to here as well

747
01:42:27,246 --> 01:42:29,836
Where are you saying
you must go now?

748
01:42:51,284 --> 01:42:53,711
Facing what...
